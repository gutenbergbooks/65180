</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Who does not remember this glorious old song,
with its simple melody, and well-managed accompaniments
that seem to chime in with every word uttered
by the singer, not only upholding him in his sentiment,
and illustrating his positions by all kinds of
impressive flourishes, but absolutely chuckling and
caracoling over the unanswerable nature of the argument?
If ever accompaniment expressed a positive
certainty that the words of a song were the truest
words in the world, it is this very accompaniment.
It takes it for granted that nobody will dispute its
opinion. It is as dogmatic as Aristotle, or Bob
Hobbes, but yet, unlike them in some respects,
it seems always to know pretty well what it is
talking about. The truth is, that there are few
persons who can remain altogether unconvinced by
its illustrations, or at least who can remain unpersuaded
by its ingenious manner of setting them
forth. We say <span class='it'>its</span> illustrations, for any one with
half an eye can perceive that the “music is married
to the immortal verse,” and that the twain are one.
We speak of them conjointly when we maintain the
force of the song’s illustrations. What indeed can
be more forcibly “put,” as the lawyers say, (and
sometimes the rhetoricians,) than the points of its
thesis? What can be more slyly seducing—what
can be more apt to take a body unawares than allusions
to “canty hearths where cronies meet, an’ the
darlins o’ our e’e?” To be sure, the case might have
been better made out if the “morning bleeze” had
been kept out of sight, or slurred over as a thing of
no moment. Neither was it judicious to dwell upon
the “flowery lea,” or the “bonny bee,” or the little
“birds in the tree,” and that sort of thing. The song
might have taken a hint, too, from our engraving,
and said a word about a girl with blue eyes (we presume
they are blue,) and auburn hair, (we <span class='it'>know</span> it is
auburn,) and another little girl and a little boy, both
with clean faces, and a dog looking wise at one side
of the ingle, with a tabby cat at the other, watching
chesnuts in the act of being roasted, and congratulating
herself that no fabulous monkey is present to
make use of her fair hand as a cat’s paw. All this
the song might have forcibly introduced—but we
presume it did its best, and we are obliged to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, we are not convinced. We were never convinced
of anything in our lives, and never intend to
be convinced, for excellent reasons. It is said there
were once seven wise men—a matter which may be
very well doubted. But, admitting this point, it was
of course one of the seven who first promulgated the
fact that every question has two sides. Late discoveries
have assured us that it would be no question
at all if it had not. Some questions, indeed, are trigonal,
or quadrigonal, or pentagonal, or sexagonal,
or septagonal, or octagonal, or nonagonal. Some
even are polygonal, while others have an infinity of
sides like the mathematical circle, and thus there is
found to be no end to them at all, as is the case with
the ordinary circle which every body understands.
These latter are questions about Tariffs, and Boundary
Lines, and National Banks, questions of privilege
and drivel-ege, and Congressional questions of order
and disorder, with other matters of that kind. Most
queries, however, appear at first glance to have no
more than two sides; and it is only when we get
hard and fast in the middle of an argument respecting
them, so that it is as wrong to go back as it is
preposterous to go forward, that we perceive each of
the two sides which had appeared to a cursory view
so staid and so definite, branching off, like gamblers
at <span class='it'>Vingt Un</span>, into an infinitesimal series of little divisions,
each as distinct and each as perverse as the
original ones. For this reason and others (reasons
<span class='it'>are</span> as plenty as blackberries, John Falstaff to the
contrary notwithstanding) for this reason and a thousand
others, we keep clear of all argumentative discourses,
as it is impossible to say when or where
they may end. By keeping clear of them, we mean
to say that we never indulge in them ourselves. Yet
we like them very well in other people. Nothing
amuses us more, for instance, than a young man who
fancies himself a genius in the logical line, and who
will take it upon himself, at a moment’s warning,
to demonstrate that two and three blue beans do not
make five. We could listen to him by the hour; and
when at length he comes to find out that the blue-bean
question, pretty much like all other questions,
is one of the polygonal species with infinitesimal
sides, we hardly know a more interesting object than
he becomes, especially if you have not been so impolite
as to interrupt him, and he has had all the
discourse to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our retiring habits, in this particular, being thus
understood, it will be seen at once that we have no
design of arguing the point with the Old Song which
we have quoted at the head of this paper. We cannot
undertake to support the pretensions of the
“flowery lea” against those of the “chimney corner.”
In the case of hill-side versus ingle-side we
beg leave to keep aloof. We do not say with the
blue-bean gentlemen that there is much to be said on
<span class='it'>both</span> sides of the question; for the truth is we perceive
at a glance that the subject has a wonderful
variety of aspects, each highly important and interesting,
and upon every one of which we could
preach a very excellent sermon if occasion required.
At a first view there is only the ordinary double-sided
question, whether the ingle-side be preferable
to the hill-side, or the hill-side to the ingle. But
then we have at once in continuation, the concomitant
sub-queries whether the hill-side be a hill-side
of donkey-thistle or of purple heather—whether there
be sheep on it or snakes—whether it be winter or
summer—whether it be a rainy day or a sun-shiny
one—whether the ingle be smoky or not smoky—whether,
in the latter case, we choose to be cured
like bacon or be left uncured—whether wood or coal
be burnt, and whether, if coal, you have any tendency
to what Dr. Blunderbuzzard calls pulmonary
phthisis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now each of these sub-queries involves a point of
especial importance, and each of these points must
be definitely settled, before we begin to make up our
minds on the main one, and the worst of it is that
each of these points, too, may be subdivided into I
cannot tell how many others, all equally momentous,
if not more so, and every one of them to be fully discussed
and permanently decided upon, before we can
do anything at all towards drawing a judicious conclusion.
So that in the end we lose both our way,
and our labor, and are forced, in respect to the matter
of this song, to fall back upon one of those very rare
questions which have really but two sides, and base
our final decision upon that. This question is simply
whether the lady who sings the song, be pretty
or ugly. The only difficulty about this mode of
forming an opinion is that the opinion itself is apt to
have something of a variable character—but then it
would be no fashionable opinion if it had not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At present we decide against the lea and give
judgment for “<span class='sc'>The Fireside</span>.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THEODORE S. FAY, AUTHOR OF “NORMAN LESLIE,” “THE COUNTESS IDA,” ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Edinburgh Review for July, 1840, there is an
article entitled “Recent Shakspearian Literature,”
very interesting to the students of the poet. It purports
to be a review of about fourteen works from
<span class='it'>Tieck’s Dramaturgische Blätter</span>, published in Breslau,
1826, to <span class='it'>De Quincey’s Life of Shakspeare</span>, in the
Encyclopædia Britannica, 1840.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As is generally the case with similar papers in this
class of the quarterlies, the article is less a <span class='it'>review</span>
of the works enumerated in the rubric than a pouring
forth of the opulence of the reviewer’s own mind, on
the occasion of a brief allusion to the productions
criticized. The author of it, in his estimate of Shakspeare,
approaches nearer the views which posterity
will probably entertain of the poet, than those which
have till now characterized even the most rapturous
of his admirers. The mightiest bard, not only of
modern times, but by far the mightiest bard that has
appeared among uninspired mortals, here begins to
assume a yet higher apotheosised splendor; and, if
not to rank among the constellations and the gods,
like the half fabulous immortalities of the ancient
world, at least to take his place in the history of mankind,
as the mind which has reached the point farthest
removed from brute matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hope the article will be widely reprinted in
our own country. Its tendency is most beneficial.
We are, from necessity, in the present point of our
developement, a hard working, practical, matter-of-fact
people—full—too full of mere worldly occupation
and excitement. Subjects in no way connected
with the higher exercise of the intellect absorb the
public mind. Commercial and political questions
unavoidably monopolize the national sympathies.
We are compelled at present to strain every nerve to
<span class='it'>make money</span>, that the ravages of the monetary tempest
which has swept like a tornado or an earthquake,
or an oriental plague over our land, may be repaired.
There is danger in this state of things that we entirely
forego the contemplation of those subjects,
which, however without temporal pecuniary profit,
repay the laborer with moral purity and elevation,
which soften the asperity of the passions, infuse gentleness
and liberality into opinion, strengthen the
spiritual part of our nature, and ennoble and dignify
life—at the same time that they cheer, guide, protect
and sweeten it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no repose, no patient leisure and calm
tranquillity in our young and rapidly growing country.
There is the same difference, I mean in respect to
literary and scientific pursuits, between us and some
of the European communities, Germany for instance,
that there was between the Israelites travelling
through the desert and the same people when gathered
around the temple in the holy city. I believe we,
too, are undergoing a kind of forty years’ penance, in
order to shake off such of the habits and opinions of
our European ancestors as are wrong—six thousand
years of bloody prejudices and political errors.
There will come a day of prosperity, when institutions
shall be no longer doubtful, national character
no longer unsettled, when we shall have a fixed standard
of political morals far different from any that
has hitherto prevailed in the world; and when the
human mind, under these more favorable circumstances,
will develop itself in a new manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this depends upon ourselves. Nations, like individuals,
are free agents. We can go upwards or
downwards; we can hail our Messiah or we can reject
him; and in order that we may mount not sink
in the scale of moral being, it is desirable that we
should not permit ourselves to be bound down too
closely and too continually to the local and temporary
but exciting exigencies of the present hour, that pecuniary
and political subjects should not engross too
much of our attention, lest we become altogether “of
the earth, earthy.” Music, poetry, painting, sculpture,
eloquence and science, the fine performances of
a Forrest or a Kean, have a tendency to mingle with
our daily and (when too exclusively persisted in)
narrowing and degrading occupations; something
that turns the spirit another way, and fills, refreshes
and intellectualizes the character. Such articles as
that alluded to on the wonderful and still scarcely
appreciated excellences of Shakspeare, will be as
softening and reviving in their effects upon thousands
of minds, parched and hot under the influence of
merely mechanical employments, or interested and
selfish impressions, as a plentiful summer shower is
to nature, when burnt and withered with a long
drought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reading of this article has turned me again for
a few evenings to my most favorite author, and raised
many new ideas in my mind, which is always the case
when I open those fascinating pages. I propose to
furnish, in several papers, some of the thoughts which
crowd upon me while reading him. I cannot bear to
read him alone. It is like listening to an oration from
the fiery lips of Cicero in an empty hall, or hearing
Channing address deserted aisles. I want a circle to
share those streams of light; I want to feel that the
music-waves roll to the hearts of others beside
myself. It almost seems selfish to brood over delights
so ethereal, to gaze on vistas so resplendent, to
enter a temple so gorgeous and so vast without some
one at my side to call on in the moment of rapture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is, moreover, in the article of the Edinburgh
Review, the following extraordinary annunciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the work which we should have most pleasure
in believing to represent the state of German opinions,
is Dr. Ulrici’s ‘Essay on Shakspeare’s Dramatic
Art, and his relation to Calderon and Goethe.’ This
book seems to us to be not only one of the most
solidly philosophical pieces of criticism which have
issued from the Teutonic school, but on its own absolute
merits, an unusually valuable contribution to
the literature of Shakspeare’s works. The theory
upon which the treatise rests is assuredly partial and
imperfect; and also, so far as it goes beyond opinions
already received, palpably unsound; but the aspect
in which it presents the poet of all nations is one
which has been too often overlooked among ourselves,
and grossly misunderstood by some of the
most celebrated of Ulrici’s countrymen. The general
discussions, which make up a considerable part of
the volume, we must be allowed to waive. We cannot,
especially in the way of commentary on a German
text-book, attempt to investigate either the
essence of the drama in general, or the essential differences
between the views of life suggested respectively
by Christianity and Grecian Paganism. The
religious test thus indicated is that to which the
critic subjects both Shakspeare and the poets with
whom he compares him. ‘<span class='it'>Shakspeare’s peculiar
character</span>,’ says he, ‘<span class='it'>consists in the greater purity
and clearness, decision and completeness, with which
the Christian view of life is represented in his
dramas. It consists especially in this, that every
where the two great elements of human life, and of
the history of the world, the divine guidance and the
freedom of man, stand out in their legitimate authority,
in organic connexion and reciprocal action,
and thus in the whole fulness of their truth and
reality.</span>’ He insists, emphatically, that he recognizes
in Shakspeare’s dramas, not indeed formally
taught, either theologically or ethically, but embodied
in the genuine form of poetical representation,
the doctrines of the universal sinfulness of man, and
of divine grace in his salvation; doctrines which, as
he truly adds, are altogether left out of sight in
Goethe’s view of life, and by Calderon either misunderstood
or unpoetically used. All this must be to
many of us not a little startling; <span class='it'>but there lies at the
bottom of it a mighty truth</span>, not merely important in
itself, but bearing a <span class='it'>close relation to the great dramatist’s
cast of thought</span>; a truth which, in one sense
or other, <span class='it'>does</span> furnish <span class='it'>the clue to some of the most
perplexing riddles in the poet’s works</span>. In following
out his own system, Ulrici, as was to have been expected
from its one-sidedness, has been led to many
conclusions which cannot possibly be admitted; but
<span class='it'>fewer of these are to be attributed to the essential
parts of his theory</span>, than to the peculiar way in which
he has worked it out. In several instances he has
literally resolved the leading idea, in which he represents
the unity of each drama to consist, in a substantive
enunciation of a moral precept, an error
against which he himself protests. He has erred still
further in acknowledging, as he seems to do almost
invariably, the principle of what has been called
poetical justice—a principle not involved in his own
system upon any right interpretation of it, and assuredly
quite alien to the far-reaching speculations of
Shakspeare. But a man who thinks of poetry as
Ulrici thinks, can never write of it altogether unworthily:
one who is willing to consider Shakspeare
as coming up to so lofty a standard, cannot fail to
entertain that reverence for genius, and truth, and
goodness, which is the source of all pleasure as well
as soundness in criticism; and the admirable analysis
of the poet’s works which constitute the latter
half of the volume, shows the writer to be fully qualified
for expounding such a creed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Startling, indeed! but, if true, this is one of the
most singular discoveries ever made in literature.
We have been accustomed to hear Shakspeare praised
for everything but Christianity, or, indeed, any sense
of religion. He has been sometimes represented
even as a kind of <span class='it'>neutral principle</span>, from whom flow
all opinions, all creeds, all virtues, all crimes, with
a facility equally indifferent to the source which
sends them forth. He has been attacked sometimes
as a bigot, and sometimes as an infidel; sometimes
as a whig, sometimes as a democrat; but no one before,
that I am aware of, ever undertook to show him
forth as a great prophet of Christianity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have not seen the work of Dr. Ulrici, nor are the
following papers devoted exclusively to a consideration
of our author in this point of view, but, in several
parts of them, I have so considered him. They are
not written systematically. They were commenced
with the intention of saying all I had to say in a single
article, but the subject is so large, and grew so
under my hand, that I was obliged to let my observations
run into several papers, and I soon found myself,
moreover, compelled not only to confine my attention
principally to one tragedy, but to leave many
considerations respecting that tragedy untouched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish to repeat that I am by no means <span class='it'>thoroughly</span>
acquainted with Shakspeare, and do not dream of
offering any more than the mere momentary impressions
which the perusal of such parts of him as I
happen to read make upon me. After the great students
of his works, the laborious and learned critics
of different nations who have devoted years to the
understanding of him, it would be presuming to attempt
to throw light on him. I have only endeavored
to express what I feel and see and think while reading
him, and to venture here and there an examination
of him upon the idea suggested by Dr. Ulrici, as
it may strike a reader like myself, unacquainted
with other arguments concerning it than those probabilities
existing in the plays. The theory of Ulrici
is so beautiful and so consonant to the lofty rank
which our poet occupies, that one cannot help wishing,
and scarcely believing, that it may be true. It
has the force and convincingness which characterize
the solution of an enigma. And, in this view, it possesses
something of the solemnity of the creation itself.
The creation is an enigma of which Christianity
is the solution. Without that, all is vague, contradictory,
dark; an existing impossibility—powerless
omnipotence—fiendish generosity and love—the
omnipresence of a Divinity everywhere absent—a
mockery—a paradox. Christianity makes all clear
and simple. It scarcely requires <span class='it'>proof</span> more than
the solution of any other enigma. When the Divine
secret is revealed, it is self-evident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With all reverence be it advanced, the suggestion
of this theory, in reference to the works of Shakspeare,
has something of the same fitness. The <span class='it'>creation</span> of
the poet was, before, in many places, dark and inexplicable;
but the light shed upon him by the word
Christianity makes many things clear and intelligible.
It raises him to something of the magnitude of
a prophet, and the most stupendous fabric of profane
literature acquires a more solemn grandeur by this
connection with the sacred work of God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During Shakspeare’s life, he was, it is well known,
celebrated beyond his expectations, and many of
those acquainted with him and his productions
thought quite beyond his merits. He was one of the
fashionable poets of England; his verses were familiar
to the lips of kings and queens, and himself,
besides having acquired a pecuniary independence by
his pen, received the highest honors, as he thought,
which could be bestowed on him. He was, in short,
a successful writer, and he passed away from the
earth with the agreeable consciousness of having
procured for himself a niche in the temple of Fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is pretty certain, however that no person on the
globe, at the period of his life, had any <span class='it'>just</span> appreciation
of him. Notwithstanding the triumphant success
of his career, and the high honor and opulence
he attained, his real character, as such a mighty patriarch
of literature, was not dreamed of either by
himself or any of his contemporaries. As a mind
impregnated with a fire nearly beyond the mortal
sphere—as one whose birth was an event in which
mankind were personally interested—who was to
give a name to his age—who, at that point of his
posthumous celebrity where other great men begin to
recede into the shadows of the past, was to start up
anew, in more living distinctness and intellectual
splendor—was to pass in this apotheoside grandeur
over the usually impenetrable barriers of nations and
languages, and to become (like some of the universal
and ever-enduring elements of nature—like light,
fire or air) a constant pleasure and nutriment to the
human mind—as this extraordinary, and, I may say,
<span class='it'>mysterious</span> being—no one knew him. His <span class='it'>full</span>
brightness was veiled not only from his contemporary
friends and admirers, but, as is now universally acknowledged,
from many of his most distinguished
subsequent editors and commentators. The rapturous
eulogies, the commendatory verses, the folios
on folios written upon him—extravagant as they
are—fall short of his <span class='it'>true</span> value. Even Johnson,
Warburton, Theobald, Pope, and the rest of his commentators
of the same rank, appear to have meted
out to him less than the deserved measure of praise.
It appears that the <span class='it'>comparative</span> smallness of their
minds (I mean comparative with Shakspeare’s) did
not permit them to comprehend the complete dimensions
of the subject they had undertaken. They have
all too much the air of critics, instead of humble followers
and pupils. They assume a familiarity with
him which their relative nature did not warrant.
There is a greater difference between him and any
one who has lived with him or subsequent to him, considered
as two <span class='it'>minds</span>, than is always understood by
those who even confine themselves to panegyric.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My idea of this wonderful prophet of poetry is that
his intellectual dimensions are too great for any <span class='it'>one
man</span> who ever lived to explore them by himself.
He could but discover a portion of the vastness of his
intelligence and contemplate one or two aspects of it.
No one age could completely seize all the meaning
that lies in him. It has required two centuries to
place within the reach even of superior and well cultivated
minds a just idea of him. He died in 1616,
and he is beginning to be understood in 1840. Although
aided by the accumulated Shakspearian lore
of the two preceding centuries—although the most
learned and greatest geniuses of the two ages have
contributed the beams of their science and literature
to shed light on him—although innumerable theatres
in so many lands have given his plays to the world—still
even yet, greatly as he is admired and studied,
he is not fully appreciated. There are thousands and
millions who often read his works with delight yet
without understanding half their profound depth and
celestial beauty—and even they who have studied
him the most—who have fitted themselves for that
study by their previous pursuits—who have written
books upon classes of his characters, do not yet
completely comprehend him. To-morrow, perhaps,
the wisest among them will take up one of his plays
and discover some resplendent meaning—some new
beam reflected from the human heart, never known
to them before. For myself I frankly confess I have
never understood him. Every day I make new discoveries,
and have no doubt I shall continue to do so
as long as I live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The advance of Shakspeare upon the world has
been as broad, deep and steady as the on-flow of
civilization itself. So much has been said and written
of him that, it may be, some will turn from the
title of these papers as from a thing of which there
has been enough. They will mutter with Hamlet,
“Something too much of this.” But I may assure
them that the mere idea that they know enough of
Shakspeare—that they have seen him enough and
that his praise has got to be only a fashion, is sufficient
to prove that they know nothing of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The true pupil kindles at the sound of his name—at
the rustle of his robe, at the sight of his foot-mark.
Whoever comes with a new idea concerning
him or to speak in his praise is welcome; and so
convinced is he that a part of him as yet is <span class='it'>terra incognita</span>
that he is always on the watch for some discovery
in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To my eye, Shakspeare is a world. I do not understand
by this a mere phrase expressive of the
variety and beauty of the plays, but I mean those
works are morally invested with attributes resembling
the physical globe. This planet is given by
Providence as the abode of man’s body. A vast extent
of variegated surface, when he first began to move
upon it, he knew nothing about it. The dawn of it
upon the human mind was that of a bright scene—a
circle of land—a verdant plain. The more it was
studied the more it grew in variety and size. It was
found divided into wonderful compartments and the
first dazzled wanderers beheld with joy and wonder
the huge-rolling sea arrest their steps on one side,
the ice-topped mountains towering above them on
the other,—broad and winding rivers—silver lakes—fathomless
caverns—and awful, sombre forests.
Each age since, the adventurous step of man has
wandered farther and farther, has climbed the mountain—crossed
the sea—circumnavigated the globe—and
found out what it is—how it hangs in the air—how
it revolves around the sun and many of the secrets
of its bosom. Each age since, man has occupied
himself studying its nature and forming theories
concerning it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To me, Shakspeare—although they who have not
closely and habitually studied him, may smile at
such a hyperbolical comparison—yet to me, Shakspeare
lies like this solid and wonderful globe we
inhabit. He is a second nature—a new creation—a
more amazing production of the inscrutable Deity
who formed the shoreless sea—and built the cloud
cleaving Alps and Andes. He is a significant illustration
of the degree of intellectual perfection to
which the human mind—so destined—so worthy
to be immortal—may reach even in this sublunary
sphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The theory of Ulrici accords exactly with my impressions
of Shakspeare. Such an event as his coming—such
superhuman powers of mind—such a
mixture of all that is grand, terrible and profound
with all that is tender—sweet, and aerial—in one
brain, seems fit to be linked with a great purpose.
The idea of an ever superintending Providence being
in my mind, I cannot join those philosophers who
find in our poet merely a colossal diamond or a
chance giant—as if the same hazard which gives to
the farmer an overgrown cucumber or pumpkin had
dropped the rare soul of this first of human geniuses
among men. To me—I repeat, he resembles the
globe. I see in him always, as when I travel over
any country, sweet and striking scenes. I enter him
as I do a landscape or an island; looking around,
above, and beneath me, and sure to find wonders and
beauties. Here, the bending rose—there—the silver
brook—yonder the swelling hill—and again the
shadowy forest. I stop sometimes to examine the
hues of a violet half withdrawn from sight by the
road-side—and then I am struck at the majestic
grandeur of the oak at whose root it grows. Suddenly
a storm which awes and startles my soul
sweeps over me—and then the broad sunshine breaks
upon the glittering face of nature. These are in the
<span class='it'>foreground</span> of Shakspeare, but this is not <span class='it'>Shakspeare</span>.
He has far remote wonders and beauties. If
I choose to <span class='it'>travel</span> into him, I shall come upon things
new and strange. He has foreign countries and distant
wonders like Rome or Jerusalem. There are
even in him tracts yet untravelled, and secrets—like
the Pyramids and hieroglyphics of Egypt, like the
Polar seas and the central wastes of Africa—which
future time will perhaps unravel, but which we do
not yet understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meaning of <span class='it'>Othello</span> has always been locked
from me. I have not yet been a reader of commentators
and, perhaps, some of the crowd of distinguished
writers who, ever since his death, have been endeavoring
to throw light on him, may have accounted
for the till now inexplicable mystery of it. But I
could never conceive it. Why a perfectly noble mind,
should be so cruelly tortured without guilt on its own
part; why a scene of innocent happiness should be
thus wantonly destroyed was always an unanswerable
question I asked myself on seeing or reading
this, one of the greatest of his five great tragedies.
The reader will find the mystery solved, by an extract,
in the course of these papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Hamlet</span> is yet full of unexplained mystery. Why
he does not kill the bloody usurper? Why he ill
treats Ophelia? Was he mad? etc. etc. etc., are
long standing themes of debate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='it'>Tempest</span>, Act I. Scene 2, when Prospero is
telling his history to Miranda, there is one of these
little enigmas which lie in our poet like the veil
sometimes thrown over the intentions of nature,
known only to those who study her habitually.</p>

<div class='dramastart'><!----></div>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='sc'>Prospero.</span> Thy false uncle—</p>
<p class='dramaline'><span class='it'>Dost thou attend me?</span></p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='sc'>Miranda.</span> Sir, most heedfully.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='sc'>Pro.</span> Being once perfected how to grant suits,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>How to deny them; whom to advance, and whom</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To trash for over-topping: new created</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The creatures that were mine, <span class='it'>I say</span>, or chang’d ’em,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or else new form’d ’em: having both the key</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ the state</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To what tune pleas’d his ear; that now he was</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The ivy, which had hid my princely trunk,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And suck’d my verdure out on’t.—<span class='it'>Thou attend’st not.</span></p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='sc'>Mira.</span> O, good sir, I do.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='sc'>Pro.</span> <span class='it'>I pray thee, mark me.</span></p>
<p class='dramaline'>I thus, neglecting worldly ends, all dedicate</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To closeness, and the bettering of my mind,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With that, which, but by being so retired,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>O’er-priz’d all popular rate, in my false brother</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Awak’d an evil nature: and my trust,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Like a good parent, did beget of him</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A falsehood, in its contrary as great</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As my trust was; which had, indeed, no limit,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Not only with what my revenue yielded,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But what my power might else exact,—like one,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who having unto truth, by telling of it,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Made such a sinner of his memory,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To credit his own lie,—he did believe</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He was indeed the duke; out of the substitution,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And executing the outward face of royalty,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With all prerogative:—Hence his ambition</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Growing—<span class='it'>Dost hear?</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, what means the inattention of the young
girl? Why does her mind wander from a history—one
would suppose the most interesting revelation
which could be made to her—so that her father
cannot, apparently, keep her attention to the end of
it? Thousands of people read and see this play
without knowing that she is under the operation of a
<span class='it'>sleeping-spell</span>, administered by her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, why is Prospero so harsh and coarse to
Ariel? The most delicate creature that ever man
had to do with—all gentleness—all submission, yet
hear how the great and good magician uses him.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SCOURING THE CHANNEL.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“How is the night overhead?” asked Westbrook,
as I came down into the mess-room, and, pushing
the jug toward me, he added, “you see, we’re going
to make a night of it; take a pull at the Jamaica—it’s
rare stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Misty, with a light breeze; we’ll make the land,
if we keep on this course, before morning. We’ve
harried the enemy’s shipping enough in the chops of
the channel—I can’t see what the skipper means by
running in so close to the English coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faith! he’s after some harum-scarum prank—blowing
a stray merchantman out of water in sight
of land, or throwing a shot into Portsmouth by way
of bravado to the fleet. Well, what need we care?
A short life and a merry one—cut away at the junk,
my good fellow; cut deeper—ay! that’s it, a slice
like we lawyers take of our client’s money, the better
half of the whole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lawyer!—what do you know of the profession?”
said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was once a lawyer myself,” said he, as he
transferred a huge slice of the beef into his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lawyer!—a land shark!—you a lawyer!”
were the exclamations of astonishment which burst
from every lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! am I the first jolly fellow who gave up a
bad trade for a good one? I beg your pardon, Parker—I
believe you come from a race of lawyers;
but if so, it is no more than happened to myself. My
friends made a land shark of me, but as nature intended
me for something better, the experiment
failed. My first case was enough for me, and I cut
the profession, or, rather, it cut me. The court asked
me to repeat an authority I had quoted, but I was so
taken aback by something that had happened to me
just before, and which I’ll tell you by and bye, that,
for the life of me, I couldn’t call to mind a single
point decided. I grew embarrassed, stammered,
looked down, came to a dead halt; and at length,
when I heard the spectators tittering around me, I
grasped my hat, shot from the court-house, and have
never entered one since without an anguish shiver.
The judge said I was a fool; my client agreed with
him; I never got a cent; everybody laughed at me;
and so I kicked Coke and Plowden into the fire,
cursed the law to my heart’s content, and took to the
service in a fortnight, thinking it better to thrive on
biscuit and salt junk, than to work for nothing and
starve for my pains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shure, and a dacent gentleman”—said O’Shaughnessy—“would
have been spoilt in making a black-gown
of you, Westbrook. But it was a great mistake,
that breaking down in your spache; you should
have served them like my old chum, Terence McBalawhangle,
thricked the tutors of Trinity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How was that?” asked the mess, in a breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fath, pour us out a brimmer, and I’ll tell you
the same. A nate, dacent lad, and a witty, was Terence;
and many’s the time he’s made my sides ache
for a week, by raison of laughing at his droll sayings,
the sinner. And I thought I should have died
when the tutor tould him to recite the task from the
essay on the human understanding—a crusty, metaphysical
work, bad cess to it. Divil a bit did Terence
know of the same—he hadn’t a turn, he said,
for the dry bones of Ezakiel—but he put a good face
on the matter, and ran on, like a petrel over the
waves, never halting even to breathe, until the tutor
stopped him, and tould him there was nothing in the
text-book like what he was saying. ‘Shure, and I
know that,’ says Terence, without moving a muscle
of his face, ‘but, you see, I didn’t agree with Mr.
Locke, so I thought I’d just give ye my own sentiments.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your friend Terence,” said Westbrook, filling a
bumper, after the roars of laughter which followed
this anecdote had subsided, “ought to have had a
New Jersey justice, instead of a fellow of Trinity,
to mystify. He might have succeeded better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe they’re like old Sir Peter Beverly, of the
county of Clare, one of the quorum, and never right
but by mistake. Many’s the poor fellow he’s had
transported becase the man was brought up before
dinner, when the justice was out of humor. Shure
and didn’t he send off Teague O’Daly, the brightest
lad at a wake or a fair within thirty miles around,
just for no other raison than becase Teague made
love to his daughter’s maid?—and didn’t he refuse
the testimony of Teague’s cousin, only ten removes
off, becase he said the lad was suspected of staling a
watch?—and when they all shwore at his injustice—the
gouty porpoise—he said, with a big oath that
made my hair stand on end—I was younger then
ye know—‘Constable, stop that noise; here I’ve
had to commit three fellows without being able to
hear a word of their defence.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t say I ever saw an Irish justice,
O’Shaughnessy, at least not one like Sir Peter; but
the justice court of New Jersey is almost a match
for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you see, each township has its justice, and
when the county court is held, all the justices come
up to the county town to preside at the trials. The
court-house, however, at Skanamuctum—shove us
up the jug—was always too small, and the bench especially
wouldn’t hold a quarter of the judges, so
that the man who got into court first secured the best
seat. Sometimes, however, on a hot day, the old
fellows couldn’t hold out, or else they saw a crony
in the crowd whom they thought likely to treat, so
that, one by one, they would drop off the bench; but
as there were always a dozen or two awaiting to get
on, the judges’ seats were never empty. As for
knowing anything about the case—ah! this is
prime!—they never pretended to it. Indeed, I’ve
often seen not a single judge on the bench, when the
verdict was rendered, who had been there when the
trial began.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That beats you, O’Shaughnessy,” roared a reefer,
almost suffocated with laughter, from the foot of
the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo!” said I; “you made a good escape,
Westbrook, when you gave up pleading before such
Shallows—but you haven’t yet told us what happened
to you to embarrass you so at your <span class='it'>début</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! I had forgot. I was just admitted, you
must know, and all my friends advised me to make
my maiden speech on one of the cases coming up at
the next Oyer and Terminer. I looked around for
some burglar, horse-thief, or other sort of rascal, for
a client, but not a sinner of a one could I find willing
to trust himself in my hands. I began to despair,
thinking I should never have the chance to figure
so again, for the celebrated Judge Traskey himself
had come down special, to try a desperate case of
murder, and the whole bar were itching to show off
before him. He was said to be as sharp as a north-easter,
and every other word was either an opinion,
a growl, or a witticism. You may judge my joy,
when, on walking down to the court-house, and looking
very imposing in my own opinion, but scarcely
daring to hope for such a God-send as a client, I
heard the sheriff tell me that there was a poverty-struck
sheep-stealer in the dock, who was in want of
a lawyer, and would be glad to get a brisk hand for
a trifle of a fee. Such a chance of making a speech
wasn’t to be lost, and, thinking all the time what a
sensation I should create, I asked to see the prisoner.
As the sheriff couldn’t bring him out into the
bar, I went into the dock. Well, I heard through
the poor rascal’s story—and a long one it was—and
I was just about to leave him, when I found that
the sheriff had gone, in the mean time, to bring in the
judge in procession, and, forgetting all about me,
had left me locked in. Here was a scrape with a
vengeance. To wait till the judge entered, and then
sneak out of the dock, the laughing stock of the bar,
was not to be thought of. What was to be done?
The railing around the dock was high, and guarded
by iron spikes, but over it was my only outlet, and
springing up at once, I began to clamber out of the
hole. At that very instant his honor entered the
court-room, and the first thing that caught his eye
was a man leaping the dock. ‘Sheriff, look to your
prisoner,’ said he. ‘May it please your honor,’ said
I, attempting to explain, and essaying to leap down,
in which endeavor the spikes caught in the skirts of
my coat, and I hung fast—‘may it please your
honor—’ ‘It doesn’t please me, you rascal,’ said
the judge, waxing angry, ‘to be bearded by a prisoner.’
‘It’s all a mistake,’ said I, struggling to get loose,
while the perspiration rolled off me, and I heard the
suppressed tittering around. ‘So says every thief,’
retorted the judge, in a towering passion. ‘But I’m
an attorney!’ I answered. ‘All the worse for you,’
roared his honor. ‘I’m counsel in the case!’ said I,
‘Then, if you defend yourself, you have a fool for a
client,’ said the judge, beside himself with rage. At
this point the mirth of the spectators could no longer
be controlled, but burst forth in roars of laughter
which effectually silenced my further explanations.
At length the mistake was made clear to the bench,
and I was suffered to be taken down. I tried to
brave it out, by delivering my speech afterwards,
but an unlucky mention of the word ‘mistake’ set
the bar in a roar, and so completely confounded me
that I talked nonsense at random, until I broke down
as I told you, and, since then, I never think of a law-point
without a cold sweat all over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the staff of St. Patrick! and you’re right,”
said O’Shaughnessy. “Here’s confusion to lawyers,
and a bumper for the girls!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The girls—hurrah!” sang the mess in one voice.
“No heel-taps!” and it was drank enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! and Parker has a song on the sweet angels,”
said Westbrook; “we’ll all join in the chorus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The song—the song!” roared the mess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus pressed, I had no escape, and taking a pull
at the beaker to clear my throat, I sang the following
stanzas:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deafening chorus of the last three lines of this
song, repeated by the whole mess in full voice, had
scarcely died away, when the quarter-master knocked
at the door, and told us that we had given chase to a
strange sail, and that there would soon be hot work
on deck. Before he had well finished the room was
empty, and we had all sprung up the gangway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I stepped upon the deck, I cast my eyes naturally
upwards, and, for a moment, was almost staggered
at the press of sail we were carrying. My
astonishment was, however, of short duration, for
when I saw on our bow the distant lights of the
English coast, glimmering like stars on the horizon,
I knew at once that we must overtake the chase directly,
or abandon her altogether. We were already
in dangerous proximity to the enemy’s shores, and
every minute lessened the distance betwixt them and
the <span class='sc'>Fire-Fly</span>. Yet the skipper maintained his
course. The chase was a large brig, running in towards
the land with every rag of her canvass strained
to the utmost; while we were endeavoring to get to
windward of her, and thus force her out to sea. It
soon became evident that we were succeeding in our
aim. Indeed I had rarely seen the little <span class='sc'>Fire-Fly</span>
do better. Before fifteen minutes, we were well in
on the land side of the chase, and had every apparent
chance of capturing her without the firing of a shot.
Hitherto she had been doggedly silent. But finding
now that we had beat her on the tack she had chosen,
and seeing no chance of escape but in going off dead
before the wind, and spreading the pyramid of light
sails in which a brig has always the advantage of a
schooner, she put her helm suddenly down, and,
throwing out rag after rag, was soon seen speeding
away through the twilight like a frightened bird
upon the wing. At the same instant she began firing
from her signal guns, to warn the coasters, if any
there were, in her vicinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my faith,” said Westbrook, “she makes
noise and flutter enough; one would think her a
wounded gull, screaming as she flew. But her alarm
guns won’t save her. See how our old growler will
pick off her fancy yards—there goes one now!” and,
as he spoke, a shot from our long gun cut away the
maintopmast of the brig just by the cap. She fell
behind at once. Another ball or two, sent with unerring
aim, was attended with like success, and before
twenty minutes we were ranging alongside of
the chase, with our ports up, our lanterns lighted, the
men at the guns, and everything, in short, prepared
to pour in a broadside if the Englishman did not surrender.
We saw her ensign come down as we drew
alongside, but a jack was still left flying at the fore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you surrendered?” asked the skipper,
leaping into the main-rigging, as we ranged up by
the quarter of the foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a dogged silence of a minute, and the
skipper was about waving his hand as a signal to
open our fire, when a voice from the quarter-deck of
the brig answered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve hauled down our flag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We took possession of the chase, and found her
indeed a prize. She was deeply laden with silks, but
we were most pleased with a booty of specie to the
amount of several hundred thousands of dollars. I
never saw a more cowardly set of men than her
crew. They had run below hatches, in spite of all
the master could do, almost as soon as we opened
our fire on them; and when we boarded her, there
was no one on deck except her skipper, a surly, obstinate
old Englishman, who was doggedly biting off
a piece of pigtail as long as the tiller by which he
stood. He told us that he had spoken, but the day
before, several outward bound vessels, and that nothing
was talked of along shore but the Yankee
schooner that was scouring the channel, a craft that,
it was whispered, was sailed on account of Davy
Jones, and which it would be as impossible to escape
from as from a <span class='it'>pampero</span> off Buenos Ayres. We
could not but smile at this flattering picture of ourselves
and craft. The old skipper told us, in conclusion,
that no less than two men-of-war, besides the
usual channel cruisers, had been despatched in pursuit
of us, and he even hinted, coolly turning his
quid, that he had little fear of a long imprisonment,
for we would be sure to be caught before twenty-four
hours should elapse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it would be impossible to carry off the prize,
and as the conflict had doubtless been heard on
shore, the skipper determined to end the adventure
as boldly as he had begun it, and, accordingly, he ordered
the brig to be set on fire, when we should have
removed whatever of the cargo was most valuable
and portable. It was accordingly done. When we
filled away to leave the chase, the smoke could just
be seen, curling in light wreaths up her hatchways, but
she presented no other evidence of the ruin that was
so soon to overtake her. Her forward sails had been
left standing, and her helm lashed down, and she now
lay to beautifully, drifting bodily off to leeward like
a line-of-battle ship. The utter desertion of her
decks, her slow, majestic movements as she rose and
fell, the twilight into which she was gradually
fading, and the glittering line of lights behind her,
along the hostile coast, associated inseparably in our
minds with ideas of danger to ourselves, contributed
to form a scene as imposing as it was beautiful, and
one that raised a feeling of interest in our bosoms,
tinged in no slight degree with that awe which always
accompanies a sensation of peril. While we
gazed breathlessly, however, on the fast receding
brig, dark clouds of smoke began to puff up her hatchways,
and rolling heavily to leeward, settle on the
face of the waters. Directly a forked tongue of
flame shot up into the air, licked around her mast,
and then went out as suddenly as it had appeared.
Soon, however, darker masses of smoke rolled, volume
on volume, up the hatchways, and directly, like
a flash of lightning, the fire shot clear and high up
from the hold, and catching to the shrouds, stays,
and every portion of the hamper, ran swiftly across
the ship, mounted up the rigging, and licking and
wreathing around the spars, soon enveloped the chase
in a pyramid of flame, which eddied in the breeze,
and streamed like a signal banner far away to leeward.
How wild and fantastic, like spirits dancing
on the air, were the attitudes and shapes the fire assumed!
Now the flames would blaze steadily up for
a minute; now they would blow apart like whiffs of
smoke; and now they would leap bodily away, in
huge and riven masses, into the dense canopy of
smoke to leeward. At times they would wind spirally
around the hamper; again they would taper off far
up into the unfathomable night. On every hand the
waves had assumed the hue of fire. The heavens
above were lurid. The crackling and hissing of the
flames could be heard even at our distance from the
brig. Millions of sparks, sent up from the blazing
ship, whirled off on the wind, and showered down to
leeward. Occasionally a stray spar fell simmering
into the water. At length the brig fell off from her
course, and drifting broadside on before the wind,
came down towards us, rolling so frightfully as to
jerk the flames, as it were, bodily out of her. I was
still gazing spell-bound on the magnificent spectacle,
when I heard an exclamation of surprise over my
shoulder, and turning quickly around, I saw the skipper
gazing intently over the burning ship, as if he
watched for something hidden behind her. He saw
my movement, and asked,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not detect a sail to windward, just in the
rear of the brig? Wait till the wind whirls away the
fire—there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no mistaking it. A large man-of-war,
to judge by her size and rig, partially concealed by
the brig, was coming down to us, with studding-sails
all spread, and the English cross flying at her main.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are already under a press of sail—as much
as we can conveniently spread,” said the skipper, as
if musingly, looking aloft; “and the Englishman
will have to give the brig somewhat of a berth. Ah!
there comes the enemy—a frigate, as I live!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one on board had by this time had their attention
turned to the approaching stranger, and now,
as she bore away to leave the wreck to starboard,
every eye was fixed on her form. She came gallantly
out from behind her fiery veil, riding gracefully on
the long surges, and seeming, as her white sails reflected
back the flames, more like a spectral than a
mortal ship. The momentary admiration with which
we gazed on her, as she emerged into view, soon,
however, faded before the anxious feelings arising
out of the extremity of our peril. But there was nothing
to be gained by idle forebodings. The frigate
was evidently gaining on us, and it became necessary
to spread every inch of canvass we had, in order to
escape her. Men also were sent aloft, and buckets
whipped up to them, in order that our sails might be
kept constantly wet; the masts were eased, the
water started, every useless thing thrown overboard,
and all the exertions which desperate men resort to
were adopted to ensure our escape. After an agitating
suspense of five minutes, we found that we
were slowly drawing ahead of the frigate, and our
hopes were still further raised, in a short space afterwards,
by the growing thickness of the fog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are not caught this time yet,” said I to
Westbrook, “and now for <span class='it'>la belle France</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! the skipper’s had enough of such hot quarters
as these, I fancy; at least, after such a haul of
specie, he’ll not run any more risks if he can help it.
Depend upon it, we shall be making love to the fair
Parisian <span class='it'>grisettes</span> before a fortnight rolls overhead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so fast, Mr. Westbrook,” said the old quarter-master,
who overheard us by chance—“do you
see that?” and he pointed to a rocket which that instant
shot up from the deck of the frigate, and then
arching over in the sky, broke into a thousand
sparkles, which fell shivering to the water. “If I
know anything of such sky-lighters, that bloody
Englishman has a consort somewhere hereabouts—and
there he is on our lee-bow, the varmint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We both turned around hastily as he spoke, and,
sure enough, a rocket was seen streaming, comet-like,
through the heavens, apparently sent up from a ship
well on our lee-bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the true cross!” sung out O’Shaughnessy, at
this instant, “here’s another fellow wasting his fire-works
to windward. Shure, and, as the thief said to
the hangman when he saw the crowd, we’re beset—ohone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could scarcely contain my laughter, although by
this time rockets were rising into the air on our three
sides, with a rapidity which showed that we had got
somewhere into the midst of the channel fleet, and
that the frigate astern was telegraphing to her consorts
of our whereabouts. Our situation was alarming
in the extreme. Beset on all sides, we had
scarcely the slightest chance of escape, our only
hope, in fact, consisting in the darkness of the night,
and the ignorance of our position on the part of the
men-of-war ahead. For a moment—and it was the
only one of the kind in his life—our skipper seemed
to be at fault; and he stood near the starboard railing,
with his teeth firmly clenched and his brow contracted,
gazing vacantly ahead. Suddenly, however,
he turned to the man at the wheel, and ordered him
to bear up towards the sail on our weather bow. He
then sent down into his cabin for a catalogue of the
English navy, which we had taken in a prize but a
few days before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the frigate astern had vanished in the
gathering gloom, while the man-of-war on our lee-bow
was yet unseen. The enemy, however, off our
weather cat-head, began to loom faint and shadowy
through the fog, and just as he became distinctly defined
against the horizon, we heard the roll of the
drum beating to quarters, and directly beheld in our
foe a heavy frigate, with her ports open and lighted,
and a formidable battery frowning across the gloom.
We had by this time edged away so as to bring the
Englishman a point or two on our lee-bow, and now,
running up the British ensign, we bore boldly towards
the foe. Every one saw that a <span class='it'>ruse</span> was intended,
though in what manner it was to be executed we
were yet in doubt, and more than one of us trembled
for the event. A few moments of breathless suspense
brought us up to the Englishman, and as we
passed on opposite tacks, and looked up at his enormous
hull, and his vast batteries overshadowing us,
even the stoutest heart felt a momentary flutter.
The captain of the frigate stood in the mizzen rigging,
looking down on our little craft, while our own
skipper, with hat off, gazed up at his enemy from the
quarter-deck larboard gun. It was luckily too dark
to see our uniforms from the frigate’s deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What craft is that?” thundered the English
captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Alert, of his Britannic Majesty’s navy—Captain
Sasheby,” answered the skipper. “What
frigate have we had the honor of telegraphing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Achilles—Captain Norton. Come to under
our lee. You were in chase; at least so we understood
the lights. What has become of the enemy?—he
was the same one, we suppose, who fired the vessel
whose light we saw up to windward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! the scoundrel was the Yankee schooner,
whom the admiralty has sent us down specially to
overhaul. We lost her in the fog, but thought she
had gone down towards you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better keep less away,” said the English
captain. “Fill on your course again. We shall beat
up on your late track, lest the Yankee may have lain
to, as the safest way to get off in this fog. If we
throw up three rockets successively, we shall want
you to come up towards us. If we fire two guns, the
rascal will be to windward; if one, to leeward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir!—fill away again!” and, with a
courteous wave of the hand, the two captains parted
company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the whole of this colloquy, we had lain to
at but a short distance from the quarter of the foe,
and, at any moment, if our disguise had been penetrated,
we could have been sunk by a single broadside.
Accustomed though we were to peril, our
hearts beat at this dangerous proximity, and when
at length we filled away on our course, and gradually
lost sight of the frigate, the relief we experienced
was indescribable. We kept away, cracking
on every thing we could, and for nearly an hour our
cheat remained undiscovered. At the end of that
time, to judge by the rockets on the windward horizon,
the three frigates learned that they had been
outwitted. They doubtless gave us chase, but we
were now clear of the fleet, and, moreover, had some
leagues start of them. Before daylight we had made
the French coast, and we were safely moored, before
forty-eight hours, in the harbor of Brest.</p>

cautious than you were last evening. I saw him in
close conversation with your cousin Grace while you
were dancing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so you want to make me jealous of poor
cousin Grace! Ha, ha, ha! that would be too ridiculous—a
little pale-faced thing, too timid to speak
above her breath, and with manners as unformed as
a school-girl’s! No, no, mamma, the Colonel is
welcome to talk to her as much as he likes; I am
not afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you know his taste for poetry and painting—suppose
he should discover her talents for both?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never fear, mamma; she is too bashful to develop
the few attractions which she possesses. He
dotes on music and beauty and graceful manners; is
rather particular in his ideas of elegance in dress,
and has many of those <span class='it'>finikin</span> fancies which cousin
Grace could never satisfy. Indeed I mean to make
use of her to forward my own views.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, Rosa, I dare say you can manage
your own affairs; but, at the same time, I would advise
you to avoid Captain Sabretash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you think he has never forgiven me for
my share in the affair of his sister; but I can assure
you he has quite forgotten it. He is one of those butterflies
of fashion who have no sting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken, Rosa; he has as much skill
as yourself in acting a part, and I tell you that he
never has and never will forgive you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, then, does he haunt me so perpetually in
society? Why does he seek to be my partner in
the dance, and my companion on all occasions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot answer that question, Rosa; but I have
watched him very closely, and I believe he means
you no good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not afraid of him, mamma; he is a charming
beau, and his gay wit is a great relief to me after
listening to the grave and somewhat heavy wisdom
of the gallant Colonel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Possessed of great beauty, a fine figure, a graceful
address, and a host of superficial accomplishments,
Rosa Crafts had always managed to be the belle of
every circle in which she mingled. How this <span class='it'>éclat</span>
was obtained may be readily divined, for where there
is no real dignity of character, no sincerity of heart,
no firmness of principle, all tastes may be studied
and adopted. But Rosa’s love of admiration had carried
her beyond the limits of prudence. She pleased
so <span class='it'>generally</span> that she never became attractive <span class='it'>individually</span>,
and she had attained her twenty-fifth year
without receiving any eligible offer of marriage.
The straitened circumstances in which her widowed
mother had been left, rendered a wealthy alliance
necessary to the support of the style of living which
Rosa had insisted upon adopting, and Mrs. Crafts
began to lose patience when she found her money
diminishing, her debts increasing, and her daughter
verging towards an <span class='it'>uncertain age</span>, without any prospect
of bringing their schemes to a successful issue.
It was just at this juncture that Colonel Middleton
came within the sphere of her attractions, and was
marked as a victim destined to fulfil her matrimonial
speculations. The Colonel was a man whom almost
any woman might have admired, even if he had not
possessed the talisman of wealth. In his youth he
had been eminently handsome, and time had dealt
leniently with him, for the weight of forty years had
fallen so lightly upon him that it would have puzzled
the wisest physiognomist to count their number on
his brow. His cheek wore the rich bloom of health,
his well-formed mouth still displayed the glittering
pearls which had been a distinguishing beauty in his
boyhood, the thick wavy masses of his dark hair fell
on temples but faintly tracked by the “foot of the
crow,” and his tall figure still retained its symmetry,
notwithstanding a slight tendency to <span class='it'>embonpoint</span>.
He could scarcely be ignorant of his personal advantages,
but he was by no means a vain man. In his
youth, he had been mortified by the belief that his
handsome face was more valued than his gifted mind;
and the consciousness that, whatever might be his
physical merits, his intellectual gifts were of far
more value, tended to make him but little sensible
to the impulses of vanity. But though possessing so
many spells to awaken love, and endowed with a
heart singularly alive to affection, he had been destined
to disappointment. His fastidious taste had
never been fully satisfied, and he had reached his
thirtieth year before he found a woman who could
excite a deep interest in his heart. While in Europe,
he met with an English gentleman who was
travelling with his invalid daughter, and the beauty,
the delicacy of feeling, and the gentle reserve of
Laura Pendleton’s character, soon won his warmest
regard. Her melancholy, the consequence, as it
seemed, of fragile health, was so touching, her style
of beauty was so ethereal, her manners were so full
of timid gentleness, that he became deeply attached
to her. Knowing the prejudices of her father, he did
not venture <span class='it'>first</span> to avow his love to the shrinking
girl, but taking advantage of her absence, he made
known his wishes to Mr. Pendleton, and begged his
acquiescence in his suit. He received a most flattering
reply from the gratified father, and only wanted
to be assured by Laura herself of his felicity,
when she was suddenly taken seriously ill. He was
of course denied all access to her, but her father treated
him as her accepted lover, and even went so far
as to decide that the marriage should take place immediately
upon her recovery. When Colonel Middleton
was admitted to the presence of Laura, she
was still confined to her apartment, and never, from
the time of his proposal to the hour when they stood
before the altar to be wedded, did he see his affianced
bride except in the company of her father or mother.
He did not then know that there was a design in this
vexatious restraint. Laura’s timidity and melancholy
had evidently increased, but the sudden threatening
of death at the moment of betrothment might
easily account for this, and in the mean time she received
her lover with her usual quiet kindness, passively
suffering all his fondness, and offering no opposition
when her father urged a speedy union. They
were married at the house of the British Consul, and
while her parents returned to their native land, the
Colonel and his bride continued their sojourn in sunny
Italy. It was not until months afterwards that he
learned the whole truth. She had loved another—she
had plighted her faith—but the authority of her
parents had compelled her to break her troth, and
the offer of Colonel Middleton had been made at the
moment when the certainty of entire separation from
the object of her affection had made her utterly regardless
of her future fate. She neither accepted nor
rejected him; her father managed the whole matter,
and she had culpably sacrificed the peace of both by
thus weakly yielding to despair. Some months after
her marriage, the news of her lover’s death threw her
into a paroxysm of grief and self-reproach, and taught
the husband that he had won the hand only, while
the heart was still another’s. Her feelings were too
pure, and her mind too deeply imbued with truth, to
be satisfied with the deception which her silence had
practised upon her husband; and as her inert and
timid temper had been the cause of her error, she determined
to devote her life to its expiation. But she
mistook penance for expiation. Instead of resolutely
stifling her regrets for the past, and applying herself
to the fulfilment of her duties—instead of remembering
that duty to her husband required the oblivion
of former affections—she vainly fancied that
by giving herself up to sorrow, she should make a
proper atonement for her fault; and she therefore
sought not to check the ravages which grief was
making in her health. For seven long years did the
Colonel watch over the failing strength and minister
to the daily comforts of her whose heart was buried
in the grave of another. She esteemed him, she was
grateful to him, she loved him with sisterly affection;
but she remembered the thrill which a dearer voice
had once sent to her heart, and because her husband
could awaken none of those fervent feelings of youthful
passion, she rejected the peace which might yet
have grown up in the calm atmosphere of domestic
life, and cherished her unhappiness like a bosom
friend. She died at length in her husband’s arms, lamenting,
when too late, the weakness and morbid
sensibility which had led her to waste her life in
pining after unsubstantial bliss, when true contentment
might have been the daily companion of her
existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after this sad termination of his first attachment
that Colonel Middleton met with the beautiful
Rosa Crafts. Younger in feelings than in years, he
had never drank from the pure fount of reciprocal affection;
he had been loved where he could offer no
return; he had loved where no answering fondness
became his reward; and though past the age of romance,
he yet thirsted for the sweet waters of mutual
tenderness. But with all his genius, his tact and
his experience, he was a mere tyro in his knowledge
of woman. No man has ever deeply understood the
peculiarities of woman’s nature until the intimate
communion of wedded life has given him an insight
into its mysteries; no man has ever been qualified to
portray the many-colored varieties of female character,
unless an intelligent and amiable wife has been
the mirror that reflected, or, at least, the telescope
which brought near to his view the minute traits
which alone can give <span class='it'>truthfulness</span> to the picture.
The beauty of the stately Rosa had fascinated Colonel
Middleton, and having ascertained, to his satisfaction,
that no one occupied a prior place in her affections,
he never thought of the possibility that she was
incapable of loving; it never occurred to him that
the temple might be unoccupied only because the
portals were too narrow to admit an object of worship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aided by her mother, whose skill in reading character
was very great, Rosa adapted herself with inimitable
skill to the fancies of the rich Colonel Middleton.
The little personal vanity which had lurked
unsuspected in his bosom, was fanned into a gentle
flame by her adroit flatteries, and could not fail to
throw additional light upon the lovely woman who
seemed to forget the homage due to her own charms
in her admiration of her new friend. Though timid
almost to nervousness when on horseback, she was
ready every morning for a ride with him; though far
too indolent to love walking, she never declined a
ramble with the enthusiastic lover of nature; though
delighting in gorgeous colors and an <span class='it'>outré</span> style of
dress, she affected almost quaker-like simplicity as
soon as she learned his taste in this respect; passionately
fond of waltzing, she became a perfect prude
after she heard his opinion of it; and even her habits
of coquetry, which had become almost a second nature
to her, were exchanged for gentle reserve and
modest self-possession when his eye was upon her.
But the master-stroke of policy was that which induced
him to believe her endowed with intellectual
gifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cousin Grace, of whom Rosa had spoken so contemptuously,
was the orphan daughter of Mrs. Crafts’
only sister, and for several years she had been the
inmate of her aunt’s family. A small income, which
she derived from her patrimony, rendered her independent,
and she resided with her aunt simply because
she could claim no other eligible home. But
her early education had made her very unlike her
present companions. Truth and piety were the leading
traits of her character; industry, contentment
and kindliness were the daily practice of her life.
Without making any ostentatious display of her religion,
she made it the rule of her conduct, and therefore
it was that, though she occasionally mingled in
the gay scenes in which Rosa delighted, she never
allowed herself to become involved in any of the
schemes of her beautiful cousin. Her kindness of
heart led her to feel sincerely attached to Rosa, in
spite of her faults, and her humility prevented her
from dreaming of rivalship, although, if seen any
where else than at the side of so brilliant a beauty,
Grace might have charmed by the placid and child-like
sweetness of her countenance. Her retiring
manners and timid reserve in society prevented many
from learning the full value of her mental gifts, but
to the few who knew her intimately, she appeared a
creature of rare endowments. Grace had not been
blind to the arts which were practised to attract
Colonel Middleton, but, looking upon him as fully
qualified, both by age and experience, to take care of
himself, she felt some little amusement at the manœuvres
of her aunt and cousin, until a knowledge of
his past history, together with the discovery of his
high-toned feelings, excited a deeper interest in his
welfare. Henceforth she watched the plans of her
cousin with something like regret; but regret unmingled
with any selfish feeling, for Grace, with all her
gentleness, had a proper sense of the dignity of her
sex, and did not think that <span class='it'>marriage</span> was absolutely
essential to a woman’s respectability. The affair
was still in suspense when Grace received a summons
to attend a sick friend in her native village, and
departed for an absence of some weeks, while Rosa
remained to complete the conquest of the amiable
Colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning, on entering the parlor at his accustomed
hour for their ride, Colonel Middleton found
neither Mrs. nor Miss Crafts visible, and throwing
himself on a sofa, he awaited their appearance. As
he took his seat, he observed a book peeping from
under one of the cushions. It was most <span class='it'>judiciously</span>
placed, for had it been lying on a table, he never
would have thought of opening a volume whose form
and binding bore such a marvellous resemblance to
an <span class='it'>album</span>. But the slight mystery connected with
it—the fact of its being <span class='it'>half hidden</span>—excited his
curiosity, and he busied himself in inspecting its varied
pages. He found it to contain some very beautiful
pencil drawings, a few exquisitely colored miniature
likenesses, and various short poems. There was
no name in the volume—nothing by which he could
identify the owner—but he soon found that the drawings
were all by one person, and he began to suspect
that so delicate a pencil had been held only by a
<span class='it'>poet’s</span> hand. He remembered some expressions
which had fallen from the lips of the lovely Rosa
only on the previous day; he took from his pocket-book
a little note, beautifully written on rose-tinted
paper, which he had received from her a short time
before; he compared it with the poems; the round,
clear Italian characters were the same in both, and,
with a thrill of delight, the Colonel at once admitted
the belief that the beautiful object of his regard was
as gifted as she was lovely. Forgetting the prolonged
delay of her appearance—a delay designed
to afford him ample opportunity of satisfying his curiosity—his
eyes wandered eagerly over the volume.
He was still more charmed, however, when, on one
of the last pages in the book, he met with a pencil
sketch of himself. There was no mistaking the likeness;
it was a most spirited head, and the features
were his own. For a moment the Colonel was elated
to almost boyish glee, and could scarcely refrain
from pressing to his lips this precious proof of Rosa’s
feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that critical moment, Mrs. Crafts and her daughter
entered the room. A slight blush—a modest
dropping of her fringed eyelids, betrayed the surprise
of the <span class='it'>artless</span> Rosa as she observed the Colonel’s occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray, who is the author of these beautiful sketches?”
he asked, as soon as he had paid his respects to
the ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of maternal pride on the one side, and of
girlish diffidence on the other, was exchanged between
mother and daughter, but no reply was made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are the poems by the same hand as the drawings?”
said he, still retaining his hold of the volume,
which Rosa gently strove to take from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A timid “yes” was uttered by the beautiful girl,
while her mother, pretending to hear a summons
from an <span class='it'>invisible</span> servant, <span class='it'>judiciously</span> left the room.
Colonel Middleton drew Rosa to a seat beside him,
and, as he clasped her hand in his, exclaimed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, dear Rosa, do you mean to monopolize all
the choicest gifts of Heaven? Look here,” pointing,
as he spoke, to his own portrait in the volume, “and
tell me if I may dare to hope that your own heart
was the mirror which reflected these features?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosa uttered a faint cry, and, overpowered with
shame, hid her face on the arm of the sofa, while her
white neck was suffused with a deep red hue that
might easily have been mistaken for a blush. The
Colonel was overpowered; his foible was a desire to
be the first and only object of affection to a woman’s
heart, and he could not doubt that he had now attained
his hopes. A passionate expression of his
feelings and a proffer of his heart and hand were the
only evidences of gratitude which he could bestow
on the gentle girl. What a fine piece of acting was
Rosa’s gradual return to self-possession! The blushing
timidity with which she listened to his passionate
tenderness, her delicate dread lest his discovery of
her <span class='it'>secretly cherished</span> attachment should be the motive
of his present offer, and, finally, the modest
yet fervent abandonment of feeling with which she
allowed her head to rest on his shoulder, while his
arm encircled her slender form and his lip imprinted
a lover’s kiss on her fair brow, would have made the
fortune of a theatrical <span class='it'>débutante</span>. It was all settled;
the album decided the affair, and Rosa Crafts was
certainly destined to become Mrs. Colonel Middleton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, once sure of her lover, Rosa had no desire to
become a wife sooner than prudence required. She
could not give up old habits without an effort, and
she determined to enjoy her liberty as long as possible,
by deferring the period of her marriage. Colonel
Middleton busied himself in refitting his beautiful
villa on the banks of the Hudson, and during his temporary
absences, Rosa obtained many a moment of
freedom from restraint. Fortune seemed to favor
the wishes of the heartless woman of the world, for
ere the time fixed for their marriage had arrived,
Colonel Middleton was ordered to take command of
his regiment in Florida. He was too good a soldier
to hesitate, whatever might have been his disappointment,
and the day which should have witnessed
his union with his beautiful bride, dawned upon him
amid the everglades of that wild and perilous district.
Rosa felt his absence as a positive relief. Nothing
was easier than to write tender and beautiful letters
to her distant lover—nothing more pleasant than to
return to society as an affianced bride, certain of a
future establishment, and privileged to seek present
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you be so attentive to that consummate
flirt?” asked a friend, as Captain Sabretash returned
from leading Miss Crafts to her carriage after a gay
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have good reason for my conduct, Harry,” was
the reply; “she has not a more devoted attendant in
society than myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, and therefore it is that I am surprised
at your inconsistency.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inconsistency, Harry! You don’t know me, or
you would not think me inconsistent. Can nothing
but admiration and love render one watchful? I tell
you that never had that woman a lover half so devoted
and so observant as myself; but it is with the
keen eye of hatred that I watch her every movement;
it is the spirit of vengeance which actuates my every
attention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a queer way of showing hatred. Do you
mean to continue such devotion after her marriage
with Colonel Middleton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That marriage will never take place, Harry.
Think you the noble-minded Colonel would wed her
if he knew all that I could tell him? I will not oppose
idle words to a lover’s passion, but I will bring
him proof such as he cannot doubt of her unworthiness,
and thus will I fulfil my revenge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the admirers whom Rosa drew around her
during the Colonel’s absence, was one who excited
her peculiar interest. The Baron de Stutenhoff was
a Russian, with clear blue eyes, a profusion of long
light hair, and also <span class='it'>presumed</span> to be in possession of
a <span class='it'>mouth</span>, although his bushy fox-colored mustachios
and untrimmed beard rendered the fact somewhat
difficult of proof to those who had never seen the
gentleman expand his jaws at a supper-table. He
was no impostor—no Spanish barber, no French
cook, no Italian mountebank disguised <span class='it'>en marquis</span>.
The Baron de Stutenhoff was actually a Baron, privileged
to wear the crosses and ribbons of several
orders at his buttonhole, and bearing on his cheek a
broad and not very seemly scar of a sabre-cut received
in honorable combat. He had been captivated
with the charms of the beautiful coquette, and she
was by no means displeased with the opportunity of
flirting with so distinguished a man. He became her
constant attendant in society; his habits and tastes
assimilated to her own far better than did those of
the sensitive and gifted Colonel Middleton, and when
he talked, in bad French, of his fine estates, of the
rich pomp of Russian life, of the droskas, with their
silver bells and lining of costly furs, Rosa could not
help wishing that she had not been quite so precipitate
in her acceptance of the Colonel’s proposal.
Nothing would have suited her vain humor so well as
becoming the wonder of some foreign capital—<span class='it'>la
belle Americaine</span> of some distant land, where Americans
were looked upon as savages. She fancied she
could behold her resplendent beauty clad in the picturesque
attire of a foreign clime, and winning the
admiration of kings and princes in the semi-barbaric
court of Russia. Her vanity led her into the same
labyrinth where she had so often bewildered others,
and, without confiding her feelings to her more prudent
mother, she determined to mould circumstances
to suit her new views of ambition. The Baron de
Stutenhoff was a vain man, and of course easily led
away by flattery. His title was derived from his
long service in the Russian army, since, by a custom
of that country, every freeman who has been in active
military service during a certain term of years, receives
the title of Baron <span class='it'>by courtesy</span>, whatever be
his birth. His villages, of which he boasted so largely,
consisted of a few miserable huts, occupied by
some twenty or thirty serfs, which had been his patrimony,
but which had long since gone out of his
possession to pay gambling debts. He was a weak
and ignorant man, passionately addicted to play,
and, since he had been among the untitled Americans,
he had learned to look upon himself as so great
a man, that he doubted whether he should honor Miss
Crafts with the offer of his hand, or wait for some
more distinguished woman to throw herself at his
feet. But Rosa was an overmatch for him in acuteness.
She managed to give him an idea that she was
very wealthy, and then, after bringing him as near
to an absolute proposal as suited her views, she determined
to take her own time to make a decision.
But she was doomed to have her plans developed
rather prematurely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one (could it be Captain Sabretash?) informed
Colonel Middleton of all that had passed
since his departure, and the consequence was that
the gallant soldier obtained leave of absence, and unexpectedly
returned, having met on the road a most
tender and devoted letter from his “ladye love.” On
the evening of his arrival in New York, there was a
splendid fancy ball, and, without informing any one
but Captain Sabretash of his return, the Colonel determined
to judge for himself of Rosa’s conduct.
Accompanied by the Captain, he entered the ball-room
early in the evening, and, by dint of a bribe,
obtained the privilege of occupying a nook in the orchestra,
from whence he could see without being
seen. Almost the first person that met his eyes was
his delicate and modest Rosa, whirling through the
giddy waltz in the arms of the tall Russian. His auburn
beard mingled with her dark tresses, as her
head almost rested on his breast, and his eyes were
bent with a most insulting expression upon the graceful
form which reclined in his embrace. Rosa little
dreamed of the fierce glance which watched her
every movement as she practised her fascinating arts
upon the delighted Baron. She little knew that the
quick ear of another had caught the offensive and
libertine words to which she had listened in silence,
and excused as “only the freedom of foreign manners”—as
if true <span class='it'>gentlemen</span> of <span class='it'>every</span> land did not
always respect the <span class='it'>modesty</span> of women. She little
suspected that he whom she believed to be exposed
to the bullet of the lurking Indian was suffering a
wound scarcely less severe in the crowded and glittering
ball-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this moment, when the proud and sensitive
Colonel Middleton was fully convinced of her
levity of conduct, that Captain Sabretash determined
to make known to him her utter heartlessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have <span class='it'>that</span> to tell to which you must listen now,
Colonel Middleton,” said he, when the betrayed
lover would fain have deferred his communication;
“now, while your eye is darting fire upon the false
woman who has made you the tool of her mercenary
schemes. Listen to me now, ere the voice of the
syren charm you into forgetfulness of what you behold.
Five years ago I had a sister—my only one—a
gentle, loving creature, with little beauty, but a
heart filled with every good feeling. She was wooed
by one whom I esteemed and approved; she loved
him, and they were betrothed to each other. But
Adeline went into the country on account of my
mother’s ill health, and during her absence, her lover
fell into the way of Rosa Crafts. They met at a
fashionable watering-place, and, though struck with
her beauty, he remained proof against all her ordinary
fascinations, until her pride became piqued,
and she determined to make him sensible of her attractions.
Some fool among her danglers offered a
wager that she would not succeed; she accepted the
wager, and though she knew of his engagement to
another, she deliberately set herself to the task of
robbing his affianced bride of his affections. When
did an unprincipled woman ever will any thing which
she did not accomplish if she scrupled not the means?
She succeeded. Adeline was neglected, and, for a
time, forgotten. She pined in solitude for the accustomed
tenderness which had become the nutriment
of life to her young heart, but she received it not.
At length came a letter; her lover, overcome with
shame and remorse, but led away by his fatal passion,
wrote her a wild, incoherent letter, full of penitence
and sorrow, but still designed as a renunciation
of his plighted faith. He broke his engagement
with Adeline, and then offered his hand to his new
mistress. Need I say that Rosa Crafts rejected his
love and won her wager? I was absent at the time,
and when I returned Adeline was dying of consumption.
I watched beside her till I saw her laid within
the tomb, and then I sought for vengeance on her
perjured lover. He refused to fight me. I disgraced
him in the public street by personal chastisement,
and then he was obliged to meet me. We fought
with pistols at twelve paces—I shot him through
the body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Sabretash paused, overcome by his emotion.
“Five years have passed since then,” he resumed,
“and I have haunted the steps of that woman
in hopes of yet seeing her humbled to the dust.
Talk of <span class='it'>harmless flirtation</span>! My buried sister, my
murdered friend, my own blood-stained hand, can
bear witness to the innocence of what the world calls
<span class='it'>harmless</span> flirtation!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Middleton listened in silence. He felt that
the Captain had uttered nothing but truth; yet when
he thought of her intellectual gifts, her exquisite
beauty, her inimitable grace, his heart sunk within
him, for how could falsehood dwell with so much
perfection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask Grace Leydon!” continued Captain Sabretash;
“ask Grace Leydon if I have told you a word
more than the simple, unvarnished truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How may I believe the one when thus compelled
to doubt the other?” asked the Colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubt Grace Leydon!” exclaimed his companion,
“why you might as well doubt the existence of the
sun in heaven. She is all truth—all purity. Surely
you must have seen enough of her vestal-like life to
know that if ever there was a true-hearted woman
upon earth, it is she. If Rosa Crafts had but half
the mental graces and moral virtues of her cousin
Grace, she would be an angel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Middleton <span class='it'>did</span> ask Grace Leydon; but not
till long afterwards. His decision of character forbade
him to grieve over an unworthy object, and the
moment Rosa ceased to be the noble-minded being
he had imagined her, he ceased to cherish his affection
for her. An interview, characterized on his part
by grave earnestness and sad remonstrance, and on
hers by flippancy and heartlessness, terminated all
intercourse between the beautiful Rosa and her high-minded
lover. In less than three weeks after the
rupture between them, Baron de Stutenhoff had the
satisfaction of leading to the altar the “belle of the
season;” but long ere the honey-moon was over, he
learned, to his great chagrin, that the anticipated
riches of his bride were to be found somewhere in
the vicinity of his own large estates in dream-land.
A quarrel was the immediate result of the discovery,
and while the noble Baron betook him to the life of a
“Chevalier d’Industrie,” travelling from city to city,
the brilliant Rosa was compelled to return to her
mother’s dull country residence in the character of a
deserted wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Middleton <span class='it'>did</span> ask Grace Leydon; after
he had learned that she was the <span class='it'>true</span> author and
owner of the gifted volume which Rosa had falsely
claimed, after he had awakened from his dream of
beauty to a sense of purity and sincerity, after he
had learned the value of a truthful spirit and a loving
heart, he asked Grace Leydon to share his future lot
in life, and she became his wife—his happy and
noble-minded wife—carrying into the home of her
husband the talents and the virtues which had been
the solace and resources of her hours of loneliness.</p>

<p class='line0'>Death came to a beautiful boy at play,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;As he sat ’mong the summer flowers,</p>
<p class='line0'>But they seem’d to wither and die away</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In their very sunniest hours.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I have come,” in a hollow voice, said Death,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“To play on the grass with thee;”</p>
<p class='line0'>But the boy look’d frighten’d, and held his breath,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In the midst of his childish glee.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Away, away from my flowers,” he said,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“For I know, and love thee not”—</p>
<p class='line0'>Death look’d at the boy, and shook his head:</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Then slowly he left the spot.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He met a maiden in girlhood’s bloom,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the rose on her cheek was bright,</p>
<p class='line0'>And she shuddered, as tho’ a ghost from the tomb</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Had risen before her sight.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She stood by the brink of a fountain clear—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In its waters her beauty view’d,</p>
<p class='line0'>When Death, with his haggard face, drew near,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And before the maiden stood.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Fair damsel,” he said, with a courtly pride,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“To thee I this goblet quaff,”</p>
<p class='line0'>But she turned with a buoyant step aside,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And fled with a ringing laugh.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He journey’d on, where an old man sat</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;On the trunk of a worn-out tree—</p>
<p class='line0'>A poor old man—for his held-out hat</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Was a symbol of beggary.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Death drew quite near, till the old man’s eyes</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Were raised to his wrinkled face;</p>
<p class='line0'>With a frighten’d look of wild surprise,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;He rose from his resting-place.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I come to succor,” Death mildly said,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But the old man would depart—</p>
<p class='line0'>Again he look’d, and shook his head,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE BROTHERS,” “CROMWELL,” “RINGWOOD THE ROVER,” ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are times in England, when the merry
month of May is not, as it would now appear, merely
a poet’s fiction; when the air is indeed mild and
balmy, and the more conspicuously so, that it succeeds
the furious gusts and driving hail-storms of
the boisterous March, the fickle sunshine and capricious
rains of April. One of these singular epochs
in the history of weather it was, in which events occurred
which remained unforgotten for many a day in
the green wilds of Charnwood Forest. It was upon
a soft, sweet morning, toward the latter end of the
month, and surely nothing more delicious could have
been conceived by the fancy of the poet. The low
west wind was fanning itself among the tender leaves
of the new-budded trees, and stealing over the deep
meadows, all redolent with dewy wild flowers,
waving them with a gentle motion, and borrowing a
thousand perfumes from their bosoms; the hedgerows
were as white with the dense blossoms of the
hawthorn, as though they had been powdered over by
an untimely snow-storm, while everywhere along the
wooded banks, the saffron primrose and its sweet
sister of the spring, the violet, were sunning their unnumbered
blossoms in the calm warmth of the vernal
sunshine. The heavens, of a pure transparent blue,
were laughing with a genial lustre, not flooded by
the dazzling glare of midsummer, but pouring over
all beneath their influence a lovely, gentle light, in
perfect keeping with the style of the young scenery,
and all the air was literally vocal with the notes of
innumerable birds, from the proud lark, “rejoicing
at heaven’s gate,” to the thrush and blackbird, trilling
their full, rich chants from every dingle, and the
poor linnet, piping on the spray. Nothing—no,
nothing—can be imagined that so delights the fancy
with sweet visions, that so enthrals the senses, shedding
its influences even upon the secret heart, as a
soft old-fashioned May morning. Apart from the
mere beauties of the scenery, from the mere enjoyment
of the bright skies, the dewy perfumes that
float on every breeze, the mild, unscorching warmth—apart
from all these, there is something of a deeper
and a higher nature in the thoughts called forth by
the spirit of the time—a looking forward of the soul
to fairer things to come, an excitement of a quiet
hope within, not very definite perhaps, nor easily explained,
but one which almost every man has felt,
and contrasted with the languid and pallid satiety
produced by the full heat of summer, and yet more
with the sober and reflective sadness that steals upon
the mind as we survey the russet hues and the sere
leaves of autumn. It is as if the newness, the fresh
youth of the season, gave birth to a corresponding
youth of the soul. Such are the sentiments which
many men feel now-a-days, besides the painter and
the poet and the soul-rapt enthusiast of nature; but
those were iron days of which we write, and men
spared little time to thought from action or from
strife, nor often paused to note their own sensations,
much less to ponder on their origin or to investigate
their causes. The morning was such as we have described—the
scene a spot of singular beauty within
the precincts of the then royal forest of Charnwood,
in Leicestershire. A deep, but narrow stream,
wound in a hundred graceful turns through the rich
meadow-land that formed the bottom of a small
sloping vale, which had been partially reclaimed,
even at that day, from the waste, though many a
willow bush fringing its margin, and many a waving
ash, fluttering its delicate tresses in the air, betrayed
the woodland origin of the soft meadow. A narrow
road swept down the hill, with a course little less
serpentine than that of the river below, and crossed
it by a small one-arched stone bridge, overshadowed
by a gigantic oak tree, and scaled the opposite acclivity
in two or three sharp sandy zigzags. Both
the hill sides were clothed with forest, but still the
nature of the soil or some accidental causes had rendered
the wood as different as possible, for on the
further side of the stream, the ground was everywhere
visible covered by a short mossy turf, softer
and more elastic to the foot than the most exquisite
carpet that ever issued from the looms of Persia, and
overshadowed by huge and scattered oaks, growing
so far apart that the eye could range far between
their shadowy vistas; while on the nearer slope—the
foreground, as it might be called, of the picture—all
was a dense and confused mass of tangled shrubbery
and verdure. Thickets of old gnarled thorn-bushes,
completely overrun and matted with woodbines;
coppices of young ash, with hazel interspersed,
and eglantine and dog-roses thick set between; clumps
of the prickly gorse and plume-like broom, all starry
with their golden flowrets, and fern so wildly luxuriant
that in many places it would have concealed
the head of the tallest man, covered the ground for
many a mile through which the narrow road meandered.
There was one object more in view—one
which spoke of man even in that solitude, and man
in his better aspect—it was the slated roof and belfry,
all overgrown with moss and stonecrop, of a
small wayside chapel, in the old Saxon architecture,
peering out from the shadows of the tall oaks which
overhung it in the far distance. It was, as we have
said, very small, in the old Saxon architecture, consisting,
in fact, merely of a vaulted roof supported
upon four squat massy columns, whence sprung the
four groined ribs which met in the centre of the arch.
Three sides alone of this primitive place of worship,
which would have contained with difficulty forty persons,
were walled in, the front presenting one wide
open arch, richly and quaintly sculptured with the
indented wolf’s teeth of the first Saxon style. Small
as it was, however, the little chapel had its high
altar, with the crucifix and candle, its reading desk
of old black oak, its font and pix and chalices, and
all the adjuncts of the Roman ritual. A little way
to the left might be discovered the low thatched
eaves of a rustic cottage, framed of the unbarked
stems of forest trees, the abode, probably, of the officiating
priest, and close beside the walls of the little
church a consecrated well, protected from the sun by
a stone vault, of architecture corresponding to the
chapel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the nearer slope, not far from the road-side,
but entirely concealed from passers by the nature of
the ground and the dense thickets, there were collected,
at an early hour of the morning, five men
with as many horses, who seemed to be awaiting, in
a sort of ambush, some persons whom they would attack
at unawares. The leader of the party, as he
might be considered, as much from his appearance
as from the deference shown to him by the others,
was a tall, active, powerful man, of thirty-eight or
forty years, with a bold and expressive countenance—expressive,
however, of no good quality, unless it
were the fiery, reckless daring which blazed from his
broad dark eye, and that was almost obscured by the
cloud of insufferable pride which lowered upon his
frowning brow, and by the deep scar-like lines of
lust and cruelty and scorn which ploughed his weather-beaten
features. His dress was a complete suit
of linked chain-mail, hauberk and sleeves and hose,
with shoes of plaited steel and gauntlets wrought in
scale, covering his person from his neck downward
in impenetrable armor. He had large gilded spurs
buckled upon his heels, and a long two-edged dagger,
with a rich hilt and scabbard, in his belt; but neither
sword nor lance, nor any other weapon of offence except
a huge steel mace, heavy enough to fell an ox
at a single blow, which he grasped in his right hand,
while from his left hung the bridle of a tall coal-black
Norman charger, which was cropping the grass
quietly beside him. His head was covered by a conical
steel cap, with neither crest nor plume nor visor,
and mail hood falling down from it to protect the
neck and shoulders of the wearer. The other four
were men-at-arms, clad all in suits of armor, but less
completely than their lord; thus they had steel
shirts only, with stout buff breeches and heavy boots
to guard their lower limbs, and iron scull caps only,
without the hood, upon their heads, and leather
gauntlets upon their hands; but, as if to make up for
this deficiency, they were positively loaded with offensive
weapons—they had the long two-handed
sword of the period belted across their persons, three
or four knives and daggers of various size and strength
at their girdles, great battle-axes in their hands, and
maces hanging at their saddle-bows. They had been
tarrying there already several hours, their leader
raising his eyes occasionally to mark the progress of
the sun as he climbed up the azure vault, and muttering
a brief and bitter curse as hour passed after hour,
and those came not whom he expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Danian,” he said at length, turning to the principal
of his followers, who stood nearer to his person
and a little way apart from the others—“Danian,
art sure this was the place and day? How the dog
Saxons tarry—can they have learnt our purpose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely not—surely not, fair sir,” returned the
squire, “seeing that I have mentioned it to no one,
not even to Raoul, or Americ, or Guy, who know no
more than their own battle-axes the object of their
ambush. And it was pitch dark when we left the
castle, and not a soul has seen us here; so it is quite
impossible they should suspect—and hark! there
goes the bell; and see, sir, see—there they come
trooping through the oak trees down the hill!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And indeed, as he spoke, the single bell of the
small chapel began to chime with the merry notes
that proclaim a bridal, and a gay train of harmless,
happy villagers might be seen, as they flocked along,
following the footsteps of the gray-headed Saxon
monk, who, in his frock and cowl, with corded waist
and sandalled feet, led the procession. Six young
girls followed close behind him, dressed in blue skirts
and russet jerkins, but crowned with garlands of
white May flowers, and May wreaths wound like
scarfs across their swelling bosoms, and hawthorn
branches in their hands, singing the bridal carol in
the old Saxon tongue, in honor of the pride of the village,
the young and lovely Marian. She was indeed
the very personification of all the poet’s dreams of
youthful beauty; tall and slender in her figure, yet
exquisitely, voluptuously rounded in every perfect
outline, with a waist of a span’s circumference, wide
sloping shoulders, and a bust that, for its matchless
swell, as it struggled and throbbed with a thousand
soft emotions, threatening to burst from the confinement
of her tight-fitting jacket, would have put to
shame the bosom of the Medicean Venus. Her complexion,
wherever the sun had not too warmly kissed
her beauties, was pure as the driven snow, while her
large, bright blue eyes, red laughing lip, and the luxuriant
flood of sunny golden hair, which streamed
down in wild, artless ringlets to her waist, made her
a creature for a prince’s, or more, a poet’s adoration.
But neither prince nor poet was the god of that fair
girl’s idolatry; but one of her own class, a Saxon
youth, a peasant—nay, a serf—from his very cradle
upward the born thrall of Hugh de Mortemar, lord
of the castle and the hamlet at its foot, named, from
its situation in the depths of Charnwood, Ashby in
the Forest. But there was now no graven collar
about the sturdy neck of the young Saxon, telling of
a suffering servitude; no dark shade of gloom in his
full glancing eye; no sullen doggedness upon his lip,
for he was that day, that glad day, a freeman—a
slave no longer—but free, free, by the gift of his
noble master—free as the wild bird that sung so
loudly in the forest—free as the liberal air that bore
the carol to his ears. His frock of forest green and
buskins of the untanned deer-hide set off his muscular,
symmetrical proportions, and his close-curled
short auburn hair showed a well turned and shapely
head. Behind this gay and happy pair came several
maids and young men, two and two, and after these
an old gray-headed man, the father of the bride, and
leaning on his arm an aged matron, the widowed
mother of the enfranchised bridegroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merrily rung the gay, glad bells, and blithely
swelled up the bridal chorus as they collected on the
little green before the ancient arch, and slowly filed
into the precincts of the forest shrine; but very
speedily their merriment was changed into dismay
and terror and despair, for scarcely had they passed
into the sacred building, before the knight, with his
dark followers, leaped into their saddles, and thundering
down the hill at a tremendous gallop, surrounded
the chapel before the inmates had even time
to think of any danger. It was a strange, wild contrast,
the venerable priest within pronouncing even
then the nuptial blessing, and proclaiming over the
bright young pair the union made by God, which
thenceforth no man should dissever—the tearful
happiness of the blushing bride, the serious gladness
of the stalwart husband, the kneeling peasantry, the
wreaths of innocent flowers; and at the gate the
stern, dark men-at-arms, with their scarred savage
features, and their gold-gleaming harness and raised
weapons. A loud shriek burst from the lips of the
sweet girl, as, lifting her eyes to the sudden clang
and clatter that harbingered those dread intruders,
she saw and recognized upon the instant the fiercest
of the Norman tyrants—dreaded by all his neighbors
far and near, but most by the most virtuous and
young and lovely—the bold, bad Baron of Maltravers.
He bounded to the earth as he reached the
door, and three of his followers leaped from their
horses likewise, one sitting motionless in his war-saddle,
and holding the four chargers. “Hold,
priest!” he shouted, as he entered, “forbear this
mummery; and thou, dog Saxon, think not that
charms like these are destined to be clasped in rapture
by any arms of thy low slavish race!” and with
these words he strode up to the altar, seemingly fearless
of the least resistance, while his men kept the
door with brandished weapons. Mute terror seized
on all, paralyzed utterly by the dread interruption—on
all but the bold priest and the stout bridegroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, rather forbear thou, Alberic de Maltravers!
These two are one forever—wo be to those who part
them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tush, priest—tush, fool!” sneered the fierce
Baron, as he seized him by the arm, and swinging
him back rudely, advanced upon the terrified and
weeping girl, who was now clinging to the very rails
of the high altar, trusting, poor wretch, that some
respect for that sanctity of place which in old times
had awed even heathens, might now prevail with one
whom no respect for anything divine or human had
ever yet deterred from doing his unholy will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! dog!” cried he, in fiercer tones, that filled
the chapel as it were a trumpet, seeing the Saxon
bridegroom lift up a heavy quarter-staff which lay
beside him, and step in quietly but very resolutely
in defence of his lovely wife—“Ha! dog and slave,
dare you resist a Norman and a noble?—back, serf,
or die the death!” and he raised his huge mace to
strike him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No serf, sir, nor slave either,” returned the Saxon,
firmly, “but a freeman, by my good master’s
gift, and a landholder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, master freeman and landholder,” replied
the other, with a bitter sneer, “if such names please
you better, stand back—for Marian lies on no bed
but mine this night—stand back, before worse come
of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will die rather”—was the answer—“Then die!
fool! die!” shouted the furious Norman, and with
the words he struck full at the bare brow of the dauntless
Saxon with his tremendous mace—it fell, and
with dint that would have crushed the strongest helmet
into a thousand splinters—it fell, but by a dexterous
sleight the yeoman swung his quarter-staff
across the blow, and parried its direction, although
the tough ash pole burst into fifty shivers—it fell
upon the carved rails of the altar and smashed them
into atoms; but while the knight who had been somewhat
staggered by the impetus of his own misdirected
blow, was striving to recover himself, the young man
sprang upon him, and grappling him by the throat,
gained a short-lived advantage. Short-lived it was
indeed, and perilous to him that gained—for although
there were men enough in the chapel, all armed with
quarter-staves, and one or two with the genuine
brown bill, to have overpowered the four Normans,
despite their war array—yet so completely were
they overcome by consternation, that not one moved
a step to aid him; the priest, who had alone showed
any spark of courage, being impeded by the shrieking
women, who, clinging to the hem of his vestments,
implored him for the love of God to save
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant that fierce grapple was at an end, for
in the twinkling of an eye, two of the men-at-arms
had rushed upon him and dragged him off their lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now by the splendor of God’s brow,” shouted the
enraged knight, “thou art a sweet dog thus to brave
thy masters. Nay! harm him not. Raoul,”—he
went on—“harm not the poor dog,”—as his follower
had raised his battle axe to brain him,—“harm him
not, else we should raise the ire of that fool, Mortemar!
Drag him out—tie him to the nearest tree,
and this good priest beside him—before his eyes we
will console this fair one.” And with these words
he seized the trembling girl, forcing her from the
altar, and encircling her slender waist in the foul
clasp of his licentious arms. “And ye,” he went on,
lashing himself into fury as he continued,—“and ye
churl Saxons, hence!—hence dogs and harlots to
your kennels!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No further words were needed, for his orders were
obeyed by his own men with the speed of light, and
the Saxons overjoyed to escape on any terms, rushed
in a confused mass out of the desecrated shrine, and
fled in all directions, fearful of further outrage.—Meanwhile,
despite the struggles of the youth, and
the excommunicating anathemas which the priest
showered upon their heads, the men-at-arms bound
them securely to the oak trees, and then mounting
their horses, sat laughing at their impotent resistance,
while with a refinement of brutality worthy of actual
fiends, Alberic de Maltravers bore the sweet wife
clasped to his iron breast, up to the very face of her
outraged, helpless husband, and tearing open all her
jerkin, displayed to the broad light the whole of her
white, panting bosom, and poured from his foul, fiery
lips a flood of lustful kisses on her mouth, neck, and
bosom, under the very eyes of his tortured victim.
To what new outrage he might have next proceeded,
must remain ever doubtful, for at this very instant the
long and mellow blast of a clearly winded bugle came
swelling through the forest succeeded by the bay of
several bloodhounds, and the loud, ringing gallop of
many fast approaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” shouted he, “ten thousand curses on him;
here comes de Mortemar. Quick—quick—away!
Here, Raoul, take the girl, buckle her tight to your
back with the sword-belt, and give me your two-handed
blade; I lost my mace in the chapel!—That’s
right! quick! man—that’s right—now,
then, be off—ride for your life—straight to the castle;
we will stop all pursuit. Fare thee well, sweet
one, for a while—we will conclude hereafter what
we have now commenced so fairly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he spoke, he also mounted his strong
charger, and while the man, Raoul, dashed his spurs
rowel-deep into his horse’s flanks, and went off at a
thundering gallop, the other four followed him at a
slower pace, leaving the Saxons in redoubled anguish—redoubled
by the near hope of rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for once villany was not permitted to escape
due retribution, for ere the men-at-arms, who led the
flight, had crossed the little bridge, a gallant train
came up at a light canter from the wood, twenty or
thirty archers, all with their long bows bent, and their
arrows notched and ready, with twice as many foresters
on foot, with hounds of every kind, in slips
and leashes, and at their head a man of as noble presence
as ever graced a court or reined a charger. He
was clad in a plain hunting frock of forest green, with
a black velvet bonnet and a heron’s plume, and wore
no other weapon but a light hunting sword—but
close behind him rode two pages, bearing his knightly
lance with its long pennon, his blazoned shield, and
his two-handed broadsword. It was that brave and
noble Norman, Sir Hugh de Mortemar. His quick
eye in an instant took in the whole of the confused
scene before him, and understood it on the instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alberic de Maltravers!” he cried, in a voice
clear and loud as the call of a silver trumpet, “before
God he shall rue it,” and with the words he
snatched his lance from the page, and dashing spurs
into his splendid Spanish charger, thundered his
orders out with the rapid rush of a winter’s torrent.
“Bend your bows, archers,—draw home your arrows
to the head! stand, thou foul ravisher, dishonored
Norman, false gentleman, and recreant knight!
Stand on the instant, or we shoot! Cut loose the
yeoman from the tree, ye varlets, and the good priest.
Randal, cast loose the bloodhounds down to the bridge
across yon knoll, and lay them on the track of that
flying scoundrel. Ha! they will meet us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so in truth they did, for seeing that he could
not escape the deadly archery, Alberic de Maltravers
wheeled short on his pursuers, and shouted his war-cry—“Saint
Paul for Alberic!—false knight and
liar in your throat. Saint Paul! Saint Paul! charge
home,”—and with the words the steel-clad men-at-arms
drove on, expecting by the weight of their harness
to ride down and scatter the light archery like
chaff. Unarmed although he was, De Mortemar
paused not—not for a moment!—but galloped in
his green doublet as gallantly upon his foe as though
he had been sheathed in steel. He had but one advantage—but
one hope!—to bear his iron-clad opponent
down at the lance point, without closing—on!
they came, on!—Maltravers swinging his two-handed
sword aloft, and trusting in his mail to turn
the lance’s point—de Mortemar with his long spear
in rest—“Saint Paul! Saint Paul!”—they met!
the dust surged up in a dense cloud! the very earth
appeared to shake beneath their feet!—but not a
moment was the conflict doubtful.—Deep! deep!
through his linked mail, and through his leathern
jerkin, and through his writhing flesh, the grinded
spear head shove into his bosom, and came out at his
back, the ash staff breaking in the wound. Down he
went, horse and man!—and down, at one close volley
of the grey goose shafts, down went his three
companions!—one shot clear through the brain by
an unerring shaft—the others stunned and bruised,
their horses both slain under them. “Secure them,”
shouted Hugh, “bind them both hand and foot, and
follow,”—and he paused not to look upon his slain
assailant, but galloped down the hill, followed by
half his train, the bloodhounds giving tongue fiercely,
and already gaining on the fugitive. It was a fearful
race, but quickly over!—for though the man-at-arms
spurred desperately on, his heavy Norman horse,
oppressed, moreover, by his double load, had not a
chance in competing with the proud Andalusian of
de Mortemar. Desperately he spurred on—but now
the savage hounds were up with him—they rushed
full at the horse’s throat and bore him to the earth—another
moment, Raoul was a bound captive, and
Marian, rescued by her liege lord, and wrapt in his
own mantle, was clasped in the fond arms of her husband!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How now, good priest,” exclaimed sir Hugh,
“are these two now fast wedded?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As fast, fair sire, as the holy rites may wed
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then ring me, thou knave, Ringan, a death peal!
Thou, Gilbert, and thou, Launcelot, make me three
halters, quick—nay! four—the dead knight shall
swing, as his villainy well merits, beside the living
knaves!—Sing me a death chant, priest, for these
are judged to death, unhouselled and unshriven!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a word did the ruffians answer, they knew that
prayer was useless, and with dark frowning brows,
and dauntless bearing, they met their fate, impenitent
and fearless. For Marian begged their lives in
vain. De Mortemar was pitiless in his just wrath!
And the spurs were hacked from the heels of the dead
knight, and the base halter twisted round his cold
neck, and his dishonored corpse hung up upon the
very tree to which he had bade bind the Saxon bridegroom.
And the death peals were sung, and the
death hymn was chanted; and ere the sounds of
either had died away in the forest echoes, the three
marauders writhed out their villain souls in the mild
air, and swung three grim and ghastly monuments of
a foul crime and fearful retribution—and this dread
rite consummated the Saxon’s bridal!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY J. ROSS BROWNE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Book I.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>No excuse is necessary for giving my autobiography
to the public. It is true I am but a timid gentleman—a
quiet, inoffensive sort of person, too diffident
of my own powers to be celebrated, and too
much averse to the bustle of the world to figure as a
politician or public character of any sort; yet I cannot
help thinking there are some passages in my life
which will be read with profit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I attained my eighteenth year without more reverses
of fortune than usually attend a youth of romantic
aspirations and of a poetic and visionary turn
of mind. I was a curious mixture of boldness and
timidity. My parents formerly lived in a very
mountainous part of the country; and while most of
my days were spent in daring exploits amidst crags
and precipices, at night I trembled to meet, in the
social circle of neighbors, a bright eye or a dimpled
cheek. The extreme bashfulness with which I approached
the other sex of my own age subjected me
to a good deal of ridicule, and finally caused me, in
self-defence, to ascribe my repugnance to their society
to what was anything but the true cause—an
intuitive hatred of womankind. And truly my conduct
supported the assertion. Never was there a
greater mope or a more decided book-worm. I pretended
society had no charms for me. I affected to
look with indifference on the most fascinating beauty.
I shunned all intercourse with the daughters of the
neighboring gentry. All this arose, in fact, from my
excessive timidity. I never could look upon a young
female, however common-place her attractions, without
the utmost agitation. When I attempted to
speak, I invariably blushed, and my heart beat violently.
Thus unfortunately organized, I reached, as
I observed before, my eighteenth year. Until this
time I had kept almost entirely aloof from female
society, and, as a matter of course, my heart was
still my own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several years past I had lived in town. City
life had no charms for me, but circumstances compelled
me to make a virtue of necessity; and in studiously
avoiding contact with the beautiful and accomplished
beings who beset me on all sides, I found
my leisure hours very well occupied. My parents
urged upon me the necessity of mingling more in
society. They assured me my awkwardness would
soon give way to ease and grace if I did so, and
spared no pains to show me how much depended on
polished manners and a graceful demeanor. I had
two sisters, accomplished and elegant. Every opportunity
afforded by their extensive acquaintance and
flattering popularity was at my disposal; but I
could not overcome that diffidence which nature had
implanted in me, and in spite of the solicitations of
my family, I remained what I had always been—a
timid, visionary youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the summer of my eighteenth year had
passed away, I accidentally acquired the friendship
of a middle aged gentleman, who had passed most of
his life in the boudoir and drawing-room. Mr. Desmond
was a warm-hearted, agreeable sort of person,
deeply versed in books, but too good-natured to be
pedantic, and too diffident to pique himself on the
extent of his knowledge, which, in reality, was what
prompted me to cultivate his acquaintance. At first
our conversation was purely literary. I was charmed
with the wonderful taste he displayed in criticising
the literature of the day; but I soon found that his
discrimination was not confined to topics of this nature.
He discoursed fluently on scientific subjects,
while with equal ease he could touch upon the tritest
gossip afloat. Insensibly I found myself, a few
evenings after our first meeting, listening with great
delight to an exordium on the sex. I had never
found any one whose sentiments respecting matters
of this kind were so judicious and so happy. I felt
the full force of every word he advanced in favor of
cultivating the society of the amiable—the beautiful.
My feelings, naturally ardent, were wrought to
the highest pitch of excitement, and I fervently
hoped my unfortunate temperament would not forever
exclude me from the charms he so eloquently
eulogised. Mr. Desmond, unlike the generality of
my acquaintances, did not ridicule me. Indeed he
kindly remarked, instead of regarding my excessive
bashfulness as anything to my discredit, that he
looked upon it as an evidence of a good heart and an
amiable disposition, and trusted I would never stifle
the best traits which nature had given me—a modest
mien and a feeling mind. I felt exceedingly grateful
for the interest he seemed to take in my welfare, and
for the charitable opinion he expressed of my failings.
At the same time he earnestly advised me to
avoid as much as possible being too sensitive, and assured
me that by pondering less, and mingling more
in society, I would be not only happier, but better
adapted to meet the cares of the world. Deeply impressed
with the truth of this remark, I resolved to
follow his advice, whatever might be the sacrifice on
my part. An opportunity soon occurred. Like an
unskilled skater beginning his career, I conceived it
extremely fortunate that my <span class='it'>début</span> was to be gradual.
I was invited by Mr. Desmond to spend an evening
with a few of his female acquaintances. I had
heard him speak of the two Miss Melvilles as very
amiable girls—angelic beings—modest, witty and
intelligent; but I confess these exordiums, however
warm and sincere from the mouth of Mr. Desmond,
did not prepossess me in favor of the young ladies so
enthusiastically described. There was something,
however, in one of the names that struck my fancy.
Virginia—a soft, pretty name, full of love and
euphony—Virginia Melville! I really thought it
extremely beautiful. And Emily, too—an exquisite
name, but not so charming as Virginia. Virginia
Melville, I fancied, could not but be pretty—interesting,
at least. With a fluttering heart, I followed
my friend into the drawing-room of Mrs. Melville’s
residence, where I was introduced to the young sisters.
My bashfulness was entirely overcome by the
admiration which their charms and conversation excited.
My most extravagant anticipations relative
to the beauty of Virginia Melville were fully realized.
I had never seen, had never conceived, a being so
perfect—so angelic. She had not reached her sixteenth
year, and nothing save her intelligent mind
and fine intellectual eye bespoke a more matured
age. Her figure was slight—almost ethereal—yet
sufficiently developed to convey the idea of a budding
rose. It left an impression on the mind of the
beholder, that, while nothing could then add to its
captivating gracefulness—nothing make it more
perfect—time, by its mellowing influence, would increase
the softness of the contour, and render that
which seemed unrivalled still more exquisitely,
transcendently beautiful. Timidly I raised my eyes
to a countenance which I shall never forget. It was
characterized by all the graces of physical and intellectual
beauty combined; yet ineffable as the former
were, they were truly eclipsed by the superior
brilliancy of the latter. I had never dreamed of features
so faultless, eyes so expressive, lips so sweet,
and complexion so fair and ethereal. A high, pale
forehead, a beautifully formed head, long silken hair
of a dark brown, falling gracefully over a damask
cheek and a swan-like neck, and finely pencilled eyebrows,
under which were lashes and eyes of equal
brilliancy, gave the whole countenance that intellectual
cast so supremely, irresistibly fascinating, when
combined</p>

<p class='line0'>Mingling the meek and vestal fires</p>
<p class='line0'>Of other worlds with all the bliss,</p>
<p class='line0'>The fond, weak tenderness of this!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>I felt, deeply, passionately, the full influence of
those charms I have so feebly attempted to describe.
I felt, too—and oh! if ever that fair enchantress to
whose power I have bowed—if ever she read these
lines, I trust she will pardon my vanity—I felt that
the being before me was formed for my happiness;
that my fate depended on her; that my future career
would be presided over by her image! Of all my
fantasies, this may prove the most visionary; but
before I moralize on future events, I must not omit
a description of Emily Melville, the sister of my
charmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though both were extremely beautiful, no just
comparison can be made between the attractions of
Emily and Virginia Melville. Emily was nearly two
years older than her sister, and doubtless that short
space of time contributed to effect the difference
which, while the family likeness was preserved, was
so obvious in their style of beauty. Her figure was
taller and fuller than her sister’s, and her features
were characterized by an expression of serenity and
loveliness truly bewitching. A superficial observer
would pronounce her cold, but what appeared coldness
was really mildness; and mildness was her
ruling trait. There was a languid softness in her
eye that contrasted beautifully with the bright,
laughing eye of her sister. Hers was the eye of a
Dudu—Virginia’s that of a Haidee; the one a
fawn’s—the other a gazelle’s. I was not sorry to
see that my friend seemed deeply interested in Miss
Emily Melville. It is certainly not strange, if there
is love at first sight, that there is also jealousy. I
felt quite happy when I learned that, though surrounded
by admirers, Virginia’s heart was untouched;
and on this frail foundation I was foolish enough to
build a castle. I imagined a thousand extravagant
things, fully as romantic as impracticable. I fancied
how happy I would be if I lived near a lonely little
glen, in a charming little cottage, covered with nice
little woodbines; how I would marry this lovely little
maiden, and how she would be all my own, and
how I would love her and be with her forever, and
never say an ill-natured word to her; how we would
spend our long summer evenings in rambling about a
picturesque little park, which I intended to adorn
with shrubs and deer; and, in short, how very, very
happy we would be! how exceedingly pleasant
would be our journey down the hill of life, and how
we would both die together from sheer joy and old
age! Oh, youth! child of fantasy, why lead’st thou
into error?—why buoy us with visions which cannot
be realized?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening passed away, and I am not quite sure
that I was sorry when the hour of departure had arrived.
The strange and overwhelming passion which
had taken possession of my soul filled me with embarrassment,
and aware that I acted ridiculously, it
afforded much relief to escape. With Desmond I
was abrupt, or silent and moody. I could not define
my sensations, and chose rather to keep them to myself
than to subject myself to any experimental advice,
even from my bosom friend. Taking the
earliest opportunity to get rid of him, I hurried to
my room; but I could not sleep; I could not lie
down. I sprang from my bed, and paced the chamber
in a kind of ecstacy, absorbing but indescribable.
I rushed to the window, bathed my brow in the cold
moon-beams, and gazed rapturously on the spangled
canopy above me. Everything looked beautiful. My
breast expanded. I inhaled with delight the lucid
night air, and fancied there never was a being so
foolish and so happy. What an hour—what a theme
for poetry! I had never written anything in verse,
but what with moonshine and love, I could not fail
to succeed. I opened my desk, carefully locked the
door, and examined the room to be certain that none
should witness my indiscretion. I then drew forth
the writing instruments, and prepared to lose not a
passing thought. After much difficulty I indited a
line; but not another could I wrest from my distracted
brain. I threw down my pen in despair, pushed
my desk away, and heartily bemoaning my poetic
barrenness, retired somewhat calmed to my bed. A
gradual dormancy, entrancing, delightful, stole over
my senses. I thought of Virginia Melville. I recalled
every feature of her beautiful countenance;
not a smile, not a word that had charmed me, were
lost. I saw all, heard all again. Then the whole
became confused. I roamed in a garden, where the
hyacinth bloomed and the honeysuckle and woodbine
gracefully twined round the oak, and the rose unfolded
its young buds. The place was lonely—far
from the haunts of man; yet the song of the linnet
and the thrush enlivened its solitude, and I felt that
I was not alone. And while I roamed in this
Elysian garden, I espied a beautiful rose, a fairy-like
rose, young and tender and blooming. And I approached
it and gazed upon it, and methought it
moved. I paused in wonder. I knelt me down on
the green sward, and my eyes were fixed upon the
rose. And I fancied it expanded to my view, and
wore a beauteous form. In rapture I feasted on this
fairy vision. I was silent. I felt the inadequacy of
language to express my admiration; and I gazed,
and my heart was full. The fairy-rose, with down-cast
looks, smiled upon me. That smile betrayed it;
I recognised in the disguise the features of her I
loved. I was wild—enchanted. I snatched a leaf
from a weeping willow, and inscribed thereon a
verse. I flung it on the breeze, and it was borne to
the hand of the beauteous vision. And whilst she
read I trembled. A mystic veil now obscured my
sight. Full of doubt, I rushed wildly from the spot.
I bitterly deprecated my boldness. I imagined my
love was offended. I strove to banish thought. I
was unhappy. I could think of naught but the vision.
Overcome with emotion, I returned to the garden. I
sought the white rose. Again I gazed upon it, and
again it assumed its magic form. The celestial
countenance of the beauty was placid and pensive.
I passionately implored forgiveness. A smile, a bewitching
smile, played upon her lips, and her sparkling
eyes beamed with tenderness. I rushed forward
to clasp her to my bosom. The vision was no more—I
held but a rose! I looked upon it and sighed. I
bore it away, and cherished it as an emblem of my
love. A long time seemed to elapse. I wore the
rose next my heart, and thought of her I adored.
“Oh!” I exclaimed, “why must this be?” I yearn
to look once more upon the object of my thoughts.
I can think of naught but her as I roam through life’s
weary desert. Forever I think of her—forever my
memory clings to the past:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I ask myself what is this? and my heart tells
me it is love—yea! the voices of a thousand angels

<p class='pindent'>My dream ended. With the imaginary words still
ringing in my ears, I awoke. I scarcely knew
whether to think myself the most happy or most
miserable creature on earth. Full of conflicting
emotions, I rushed out into the clear morning air. It
was now early spring. The weather was cool,
bracing, delightful. A delicious fragrance was wafted
from the neighboring woods and fields, and I
breathed freely, and felt all the vigor—the majesty
of manhood. My heart was full to overflowing. I
fancied the heavens, the rising sunbeams, the bustling
pedestrians, all smiled upon me; and I was enchanted
with the beauty of nature, the benevolence
and affection of mankind. I wondered if ever such
a thing as a misanthrope really existed, and my joyous
heart and buoyant mind answered, no! Oh,
heaven-born flame!—lit by angels, fanned into existence
by the Divine hand—what art thou—</p>

<p class='noindent'>In a state of the most delightful beatitude, I rambled
about during the day, my countenance irradiated
with smiles, my heart bursting with the kindest feelings
of humanity. Unconsciously I wandered near
the dwelling of her I loved. I watched with eagerness
for a glimpse of the fairy form, the bright
vision of my dreams. A graceful figure glided from
the door. That undulating, musical walk, those
fairy-like feet, those sparkling eyes, shining like
diamonds beneath a sweeping veil—oh! it could be
no other—it was Virginia Melville! With intense,
rapturous interest, I gazed upon her till she vanished
in the distant throng. Then, indeed, I felt the bitterness
of my lot. Days, mayhap weeks, were to
pass before I could again feast my eyes on her
charms. If the interim were to be a blank in my
existence, I could bear it; but I felt that it was to
be a desert. And, indeed, a most sterile one it
proved. When, after a lapse of months, I look back
upon the time, how slowly, painfully it wore away,
I cannot conceive how I endured all the misery I
suffered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more I found myself in <span class='it'>her</span> presence. Was
it a dream? Did I really behold her again? How
very, very beautiful she looked! Her sparkling eyes
were full of mirth and intelligence, her lips were
wreathed in the most fascinating smiles; she seemed
the beau-ideal of all that is graceful, elegant and
spiritual, and I felt—I keenly felt—how utterly
unworthy I was of one so purely angelic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the usual compliments of the evening, Mr.
Desmond prevailed on Virginia to try her skill on
the piano. With the kindest smile imaginable, she
acceded to the request; and gliding gracefully into
the seat, she swept her fairy fingers over notes which
had never been touched by any more fair or delicate.
A light, pretty air was the subject of her muse. I
listened with rapture to the flowing sounds, persuaded
that if I had heard more brilliant musicians
perform, I had never so thoroughly enjoyed the power
of music. There was a soul, combined with a precision
of time and facility of execution, in Miss Melville’s
playing, that thrilled upon the finest chords of
my heart, like the evening zephyr on the strings of
an Æolian harp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night I wended my way home, so completely
enchanted as to act like one in a delirium. I was
overwhelmed with the most delightful sensations.
For hours I could not sleep, and when, at length, an
ecstatic trance stole over my senses, I had dreams
so heavenly, so joyous, so full of love and hope and
happiness, that I fancied Paradise had no joys to
equal them—no angels so bright and beautiful as
Virginia. To describe my varied sensations for the
next week would require volumes—volumes which,
when written, would breathe nothing but passion,
wild, fervent and confused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accompanied by my friend Desmond, I continued
constantly to visit the Miss Melvilles. In the presence
of Virginia I now became silent. I could not
speak. My heart was too full. Words appeared
weak and inexpressive; and, with my eyes forever
riveted on those charms that thrilled my soul, the
hours flew past—hours the most delightful that I
had ever spent—hours which will ever remain a
bright, sunny spot in my past career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing had yet transpired illustrative of the title
I have chosen for my autobiography. All went on
to my satisfaction—though I had not the slightest
cause to imagine that my passion was reciprocated—and
I flattered myself with the belief that for once the
course of true love ran smooth. Vanity of vanities!
When has the philosophy of the Bard been in error?</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the reader will be kind enough to suppose that
a few months have elapsed since my introduction to
the Miss Melvilles, I shall introduce him to a social
group, assembled at Mrs. Melville’s residence one
fine evening in the early part of summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First in order, both by reason of their beauty and
accomplishments, were the fair members of the circle,
the two Miss Melvilles, Mrs. Annah, their amiable
and elegant sister, and Miss Azile, an intimate
friend. As a connection existed between the latter
young lady and the Miss Melvilles, which I may
find it necessary to revert to on some future occasion,
I shall briefly sketch her portraiture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Azile was one of those persons who, once
seen, are never forgotten. Seldom did there exist a
being more highly gifted in mind and person. In
her form and features there was symmetry, delicacy,
elegance and expression; in her mind, acuteness,
power and refinement. Her eye was one through
which the rays of a lofty soul brilliantly beamed;
her teeth were chiselled Parian, enshrined in ruby;
and her dimpled cheek and glowing complexion
were bowers for grace and love. She had a mind
characterized by unusual vigor. Her wit was genuine,
and when she indulged in satire, all felt the
keenness of a weapon which, though mercifully
wielded, was, in her hands, sanguinary, irresistible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ungentle portion of the company comprised
Mr. Martagon, Mr. Pratt, Mr. Desmond and myself.
As the two former have not been mentioned before,
I shall expend a few lines in their illustration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Martagon was a gentleman who, having, during
his days of juvenile indiscretion, suffered his
heart to be torn and pierced by various cruel young
ladies, was somewhat afflicted with the <span class='it'>cacöethes
scribendi</span>—a disease inseparable, I believe, from
blighted affection. In person he was large, rawboned—perhaps
a little unwieldy; but these characteristics
were made up for by a countenance unusually
prepossessing. Mr. Martagon was withal a wag
among the ladies, and his wit was really quite pungent
and original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pratt was of a different cast. Being closely
related to the Miss Melvilles, there was an obvious
resemblance, in features and mind, between him and
those young ladies. A handsome person, a countenance
mild but decisive, and a highly intelligent
mind, stored with much useful knowledge, formed
some of those recommendations which endeared him
to the one sex and caused him to be admired and esteemed
by the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having now, assisted by the courtesy of the reader,
delineated imperfectly the chief objects of my
little scene, I shall take a short respite, leaving behind
me the assurance that, in my second book,
much rare and amusing matter may be expected.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A MORAL TALE.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY EDGAR A. POE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Con tal que las costumbres de un autor</span>,” says
Don Tomas De Las Torres, in the Preface to his Amatory
Poems, “<span class='it'>sean puras y castas, importo muy
poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras</span>”—meaning,
in plain English, that, provided the morals
of an author are pure, personally, it signifies nothing
what are the morals of his books. We presume that
Don Torres is now in Purgatory for so heterodox an
assertion. It would be a clever thing, too, in the
way of poetical justice, to keep him there until his
“Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitively
upon the shelf through lack of readers.
Every fiction <span class='it'>should have</span> its moral; and, what is
more to the purpose, our modern critics have discovered
that every fiction <span class='it'>has</span>. These ingenious fellows
demonstrate a hidden meaning in the “Antediluvians,”
a parable in “Powhatan,” new views in
“Cock Robin,” and transcendentalism in “Hop O’
My Thumb.” It has been proved that no man can
sit down to write without a very profound design.
Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared.
A novelist, for example, need have no care of his
moral. It is there—that is to say it is somewhere—and
the moral and the critics can take care of themselves.
When the proper time arrives, all that the
gentleman intended, and all that he did not intend,
will be brought to light, in the “Dial,” or the
“Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to
have intended, and the rest that he clearly meant to
intend:—so that it will all come very straight in
the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge
brought against me by certain ignoramuses—that I
have never written a moral tale, or, in more precise
words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics
predestined to bring me out, and <span class='it'>develop</span> my morals:—that
is the secret. By and bye the “North
American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them
ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, by
way of staying execution, by way of mitigating the
accusations against me, I offer the sad history appended—a
history about whose obvious moral there
can be no question whatever, since he who runs may
read it in the large capitals which form the title of
the tale. I should have credit for this arrangement—a
far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others,
who reserve the impression to be conveyed until the
last moment, and thus sneak it in at the fag end of
their fables.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</span> is an excellent injunction—even
if the dead in question be nothing but
dead small beer. It is not my design, therefore, to
vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He
was a sad dog, it is true, and a dog’s death it was
that he died; but he himself was not to blame for
his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his
mother. She did her best in the way of flogging him
while an infant—for duties to her well-regulated
mind were always pleasures, and babies, like tough
steaks, are invariably the better for beating—but,
poor woman! she had the misfortune to be left-handed,
and a child flogged left-handedly had better
be left unflogged. The world revolves from right to
left. It will not do to whip a baby from left to
right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an
evil propensity out, it follows that every thump in
an opposite one knocks its quota of wickedness in. I
was often present at Toby’s chastisements, and, even
by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive he
was getting worse and worse every day. At last I
saw, through the tears in my eyes, that there was no
hope of the villain at all, and one day when he had
been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that
one might have mistaken him for a little African,
and no effect had been produced beyond that of
making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand
it no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith,
and, uplifting my voice, made prophecy of his ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful.
At five months of age he used to get into such passions
that he was unable to articulate. At six I
caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven he
was in the constant habit of catching and kissing the
female babies. At eight he peremptorily refused to
put his signature to the Temperance pledge. Thus
he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month,
until, at the close of his first year, he not only insisted
upon wearing Melnotte frocks, but had contracted
a propensity for cursing and swearing, and for backing
his assertions by bets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice,
the ruin which I had predicted to Toby Dammit
overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown with
his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so
that when he came to be a man he could scarcely utter
a sentence without interlarding it with a proposition
to gamble. Not that he actually <span class='it'>laid</span> wagers—no.
I will do my friend the justice to say that he
would as soon have laid eggs. With him the thing
was a mere formula—nothing more. His expressions
on this head had no meaning attached to them
whatever. They were simple, if not altogether innocent
expletives—imaginative phrases wherewith to
round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you
so and so,” nobody ever thought of taking him up;
but still I could not help thinking it my duty to put
him down. The habit was an immoral one, and so
I told him. It was a vulgar one—this I begged him
to believe. It was discountenanced by society—here
I said nothing but the truth. It was forbidden
by act of Congress—here I had not the slightest intention
of telling a lie. I remonstrated—but to no
purpose. I demonstrated—but in vain. I entreated—he
smiled. I implored—he laughed. I
preached—he sneered. I threatened—he swore.
I kicked him, and he called for the police. I pulled
his nose, and he bet me that I dared not do it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical
deficiency of Dammit’s mother had entailed
upon her son. He was detestably poor; and this
was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions
about betting seldom took a pecuniary turn. I
will not be bound to say that I ever heard him make
use of such figures of speech as “I’ll bet you a dollar.”
It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,”
or “I’ll bet you what you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a
trifle,” or else, more significantly still, “<span class='it'>I’ll bet you
my head</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This latter form seemed to please him the best:—perhaps
because it involved less risk; for Dammit
had become excessively parsimonious. Had any one
taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss
would be small too. But these are my own reflections,
and I am by no means sure that I am right in
attributing them to him. At all events, the phrase
in question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the
gross impropriety of a man’s betting his brains like
bank-notes:—but this was a point which my friend’s
perversity of disposition would not permit him to
comprehend. In the end, he abandoned all other
forms of wager, and gave himself up to “<span class='it'>I’ll bet you
my head</span>,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of
devotion that displeased not less than it surprised
me. I am always displeased by circumstances for
which I cannot account. Mysteries force a man to
think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there
was something in <span class='it'>the air</span> with which Mr. Dammit
was wont to give utterance to his offensive expression—something
in his <span class='it'>manner</span> of enunciation—which
at first interested, and afterwards made me
very uneasy—something which, for want of a more
definite term at present, I must be permitted to call
<span class='it'>queer</span>; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called
mystical, Mr. Kant pantheistical, Mr. Carlisle twistical,
and Mr. Emerson hyper-fizzitistical. I began
not to like it at all. Mr. Dammit’s soul was in a
perilous state. I resolved to bring all my eloquence
into play to save it. I vowed to serve him as Saint
Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served
the snakes and toads when he “awakened them to a
sense of their situation.” I addressed myself to the
task forthwith. Once more I betook myself to remonstrance.
Again I collected my energies for a
final attempt at expostulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I had made an end of my lecture Mr. Dammit
indulged himself in some very equivocal behavior.
For some moments he remained silent, merely
looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently
he threw his head to one side, and elevated his
eyebrows to great extent. Then he spread out the
palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders.
Then he winked with the right eye. Then he repeated
the operation with his left. Then he shut them
both up very tight, as if he was trying to crack nuts
between the lids. Then he opened them both so very
wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences.
Then, applying his thumb to his nose, he
thought proper to make an indescribable movement
with the rest of his fingers. Finally, setting his
arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I can call to mind only the heads of his discourse.
He would be obliged to me if I would keep my
opinions within my own bosom. He wished none of
my advice. He despised all my insinuations. He
was old enough to take care of himself. Did I mean
to say anything against his character? Did I intend
to insult him? Did I take him for an idiot? Did I
still think him baby Dammit? Was I a fool?—or
was I not? Was I mad?—or was I drunk? Was
my maternal parent aware, in a word, of my absence
from the domiciliary residence? He would put this
latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and he
would bind himself to abide by my reply. Once
more he would demand explicitly if my mother
knew that I was out. My confusion, he said, betrayed
me, and he would be willing to bet his head
that she did not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder.
Turning upon his heel, he left my presence with undignified
precipitation. It was well for him that he
did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my
anger had been aroused. For once I would have
taken him up upon his insulting wager. I would
have won his little head. My maternal parent was
<span class='it'>very</span> well aware of my temporary absence from home.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Khoda shefa midêhed</span>—Heaven gives relief—as the
Musselmen say when you tread upon their toes. It
was in pursuance of my duty that I had been insulted,
and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to
me, however, that I had done all that could be required
of me, in the case of this miserable individual,
and I resolved to trouble him no longer with my
counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and to
himself. But although I forbore to intrude with my
advice, I could not bring myself to give up his society
altogether. I even went so far as to humor some of
his less reprehensible propensities, and there were
times when I found myself lauding his wicked jokes,
as epicures do mustard, with tears in my eyes:—so
profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One fine day, having strolled out together arm in
arm, our route led us in the direction of a river. There
was a bridge, and we resolved to cross it. It was
roofed over, by way of protection from the weather,
and the arch-way, having but few windows, was
thus very uncomfortably dark. As we entered the
passage, the contrast between the external glare, and
the interior gloom, struck heavily upon my spirits.
Not so upon those of the unhappy Dammit, who offered
to bet me his head that I was hipped. He
seemed to be in an extravagantly good humor. He
was excessively lively—so much so that I entertained
I know not what of uneasy suspicion. It is not
impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals.
I am not well enough versed, however, in
the diagnosis of this disease to speak with decision
upon the point; and unhappily there were none of
my friends of “The Dial” present. I suggest the
idea, nevertheless, because of a certain austere species
of Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my
poor friend, and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool
of himself. Nothing would serve him but wriggling
and skipping about under and over everything
that came in his way, now shouting out, and now
lisping out, all manner of odd little and big words,
yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the
time. I really could not make up my mind whether
to kick or to pity him. At length, having passed
nearly across the bridge, we approached the termination
of the foot-way, when our progress was impeded
by a turnstile of some height. Through this I
made my way quietly, pushing it around as is usual.
But this turn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit.
He insisted upon leaping the stile, and said he
could cut a pigeon-wing over it while in the air.
Now this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think
he could do. The best pigeon-winger over all kinds
of style, was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and as I knew
he could not do it, I would not believe it could be
done by Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so
many words, that he was a braggadocio, and could
not do what he said. For this I had reason to be
sorry afterwards—for he straightway <span class='it'>bet me his
head</span> that he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous
resolutions, with some remonstrance against
his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a
slight cough, which sounded very much like the
ejaculation “<span class='it'>ahem!</span>” I started, and looked about me
in surprise. My glance at length fell into a nook of
the frame-work of the bridge, and upon the figure of
a little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect.
Nothing could be more reverend than his whole appearance;
for, he not only had on a full suit of black,
but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned
neatly down over a white cravat, while his hair was
parted in front like a girl’s, his hands were clasped
pensively together over his stomach, and his two
eyes carefully rolled up into the top of his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that
he wore a black silk apron over his small-clothes;
and this was a thing which I thought very odd. Before
I had time to make any remark, however, upon
so singular a circumstance, he interrupted me with a
second “<span class='it'>ahem!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this observation of his I was not immediately
prepared to reply. The fact is, remarks of this nature
are nearly unanswerable. I have known a profound
Quarterly Review stumped by the word
“<span class='it'>Fudge!</span>” I am not ashamed to say that I turned
to Mr. Dammit for assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dammit,” said I, “what are you about! don’t
you hear?—the gentleman says ‘<span class='it'>ahem!</span>’ ” I looked
sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him; for,
to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and
when a man is puzzled, he must knit his brows and
look savage, or else he is pretty sure to look like a fool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dammit,” observed I—although this sounded
very much like an oath, than which nothing was farther
from my thoughts—“Dammit,” I suggested—“the
gentleman says ‘<span class='it'>ahem!</span>’ ” I do not attempt to
defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did
not think it profound myself; but I have noticed
that the effect of our speeches is not always proportionate
with their importance in our own eyes;
and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through
with a Paixhan bomb, or knocked him in the head
with one of Doctor McHenry’s epics, he could hardly
have been more discomfited than when I addressed
him with those simple words—“Dammit, what are
you about?—don’t you hear?—the gentleman says
‘<span class='it'>ahem!</span>’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after
turning more colors than a pirate runs up one after the
other when chased by a man-of-war. “Are you quite
sure that he said <span class='it'>that</span>? Well, at all events I am in
for it now, and may as well put a bold face upon the
matter. Here goes, then—<span class='it'>ahem!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased—God
only knows why. He left his station in the
nook of the bridge, limped forward with a gracious
air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially,
looking all the while straight up in his face with a
countenance of the most unadulterated benignity
which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am quite sure you’ll win it, Dammit,” said he
with the frankest of all smiles, “but we are obliged
to have a trial, you know, for the sake of mere form.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat
with a deep sigh, tying a pocket-handkerchief around
his waist, and producing an unaccountable alteration
in his countenance by twisting up his eyes, and bringing
down the corners of his mouth—“ahem!” And
“ahem,” said he again, after a pause; and devil the
word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to
say after that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing
myself aloud—“This is quite a remarkable
silence on the part of my friend, Toby Dammit, and
is no doubt a consequence of his great verbosity
upon a previous occasion. One extreme induces
another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable
questions which he propounded to me so
fluently on the day when I gave him my last lecture?
At all events he is cured of the transcendentals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had
been reading my thoughts, and looking like a very
old sheep in a reverie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and
led him more into the shade of the bridge—a few
paces back from the turnstile. “My good fellow,”
said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow
you this much run. Wait here till I take my place
by the stile, so that I may see whether you go over
it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t omit
any flourishes of the pigeon-wing. A mere form,
you know. I will say ‘one, two, three, and away.’
Mind you start at the word ‘away.’ ” Here he took
his position by the stile, paused a moment as if in
profound reflection, then looked down, then <span class='it'>looked
up</span>, and, I thought, smiled very slightly, then tightened
the strings of his apron, then took a long look
at Dammit, then put his fore-finger to the side of his
nose, and finally gave the word as agreed upon—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'><span class='it'>One—two—three—and away!</span></p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Punctually, at the word “away,” my poor friend
set off in a strong gallop. The style was not very
high, like Mr. Pue’s—nor yet to say very low like that
of Mr. Pue’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure
that he would clear it. And then what if he did not?—ah,
that was the question—what if he did not?
“What right,” said I, “had the old gentleman to
make any other gentleman jump? The little old
dot-and-carry-one! who is <span class='it'>he</span>? If he asks me to
jump, I won’t do it, that’s flat, and I don’t care who
<span class='it'>the devil he is</span>.” The bridge, as I say, was arched
and covered in, in a very ridiculous manner, and there
was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times—an
echo which I never before so particularly observed
as when I uttered the four last words of my remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what I said, or what I thought, or what I
heard, occupied only an instant of time. In less than
five seconds from his starting my poor Toby had
taken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring
grandly from the floor of the bridge, cutting the most
awful flourishes with his legs as he went up. I saw
him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration
just over the top of the stile; and of course I thought
it an unusually singular thing that he did not <span class='it'>continue</span>
to go over. But the whole leap was the affair of a
moment, as they always say in the crack historical
novels, and before I had a chance to make any profound
reflections, down came Mr. Dammit on the
flat of his back on the same side of the stile from
which he had started. In the same instant I saw the
old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed,
having caught and wrapped up in his apron something
that fell heavily into it from the darkness of
the arch just over the turnstile. At all this I was
much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for
Mr. Dammit lay particularly still, and I concluded
that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in
need of my assistance. I hurried up to him and
found that he had received what might be termed a
serious injury. The truth is, he had been deprived
of his head, which after a close search I could not find
anywhere—so I determined to take him home, and
send for the homœopathics. In the meantime a
thought struck me, and I threw open an adjacent
window of the bridge, when the sad truth flashed
upon me at once. About five feet just above the top
of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path
so as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat and
sharp iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally,
and forming one of a series that served to strengthen
the structure throughout its extent. With the edge of
this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my
unfortunate friend had come precisely in contact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not long survive his terrible loss. The
homœopathics did not give him little enough
physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated
to take. So in the end he grew worse, and
at length died, a lesson to all riotous livers. I bedewed
his grave with my tears, worked a <span class='it'>bar</span> sinister
on his family escutcheon, and for the general expenses
of his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill
to the transcendentalists. The scoundrels refused to
pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once, and sold
him for dog’s meat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the reader will take the trouble to look in the
revised edition of the Philadelphia Directory for the
year 1838, he will find recorded the name of</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Leslie Pierpoint, <span class='sc'>Gent.</span> House No. 2-7 South Sixth St.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the period of which we write this was the residence
of this distinguished party to our story, and
still would have been but for the simple incident that
has led us to write it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on a cold, bleak evening, late in the autumn
of that year, that Major Pierpoint (for he had once
borne a commission in the National Guards—so he
loved proudly to designate the militia) was seated
before his cheerful grate, with the crimson curtains
warmly drawn over the closed shutters. The room
was partly library and partly sitting room. Rich
cases filled with costly volumes adorned two of its
sides, while lounges and one or two luxurious patent
easy-chairs occupied the other. The floor was
covered with a thick Wilton carpet that returned no
sound to the foot-fall, and a hearth rug of Turkish
fabric lay before the fire in the rich fleece of which
the slippered feet of Mr. Leslie Pierpoint were half
buried. The whole apartment wore an air of comfort
and elegant ease, combined with that cheerful warmth
and inviting repose which are so delightful of a wintery
night. There was a large round table near the
centre of the room, strewed with books, magazines,
pamphlets, opened letters, &amp;c., &amp;c. In the midst of
it stood a tall bronzed lamp that shed a soft, clear
light over all. The table turned upon a pivot so that
Mr. Pierpoint, without moving from the comfortable
arm-chair in which he was reposing, wrapped in his
brilliant Chinese <span class='it'>robe de chambre</span> (a present from his
particular friend, Mr. Dunn), could revolve it by the
slightest touch and bring within his reach any book
or paper lying on the side opposite to his chair. Mr.
Pierpoint was a wealthy bachelor, and, therefore, was
an epicure in luxuries of this description. Bachelors,
having nothing else to do but to make themselves
comfortable, can carry these little personal conveniences
to their perfection. Having said that Mr.
Leslie Pierpoint was a bachelor, it becomes us to
explain how he came to be a bachelor. He possessed
a handsome person and an ample fortune—was not
only well born, but a gentleman by education and
cultivated tastes—and even at this period of his life,
when forty-one years had passed over his head, a
child might have numbered the gray hairs mingled
with the fine brown locks that shaded his noble forehead.
Why, then, was Leslie Pierpoint a bachelor?
Let us go back twenty-years, and inquire of by-gone
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the year 1808. One of the most stately mansions
in Third street, then one of the most aristocratic
portions of Philadelphia, is brilliantly lighted.
Its gorgeous rooms are thronged by the beauty and
chivalry of the city. We mingle with them also,
dazzled by the flash of jewelled brows, bewildered
by the beauty of the wearers, confounded by the
music and moving forms, entranced, intoxicated by
the whole scene of enchantment! Let us retire a
little to the silence and shade of this verandah,
where the moon finds its way to the marble floor
through trellised vines, and where the music and
the sound of dancers’ feet reach but faintly the ear.
There are others here besides us who have quitted
the gay scene to seek refreshment of spirits in the
quiet night breeze and in the calm light of the moon.
Hither approach us, leaning on each other, arm
fondly linked in arm, a noble pair. How stately <span class='it'>his</span>
carriage, yet how tenderly he bends till his lips
breathe upon the cheek of the fair creature he whispers
to! They pause in the shadow of the thick
vines! Her eyes meet his upturned and swimming
with tenderness,—his arm glides around her waist—she
is pressed to his manly breast, and their lips
meet! It is but for an instant—a footstep is heard!
and they move on again arm in arm. His lips bend
over her willing ear as they slowly promenade the
verandah. She suddenly starts, and with her face
receding a little from his, says, in an earnest manner:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, Leslie, you wrong me. Nothing could
change my love for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, yet, there are circumstances which <span class='it'>might</span>
transpire, and which might lead you to withdraw
your affection, dear Clara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no! nothing on earth. I feel I shall love you
while I have a heart to love. Dear, <span class='it'>dearest</span> Leslie,
how can you doubt me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not doubt you, dear Clara,” he said laughing
and lifting her hand to his lips. “God knows,”
he earnestly added, “I should be miserable to doubt
where all my hopes of happiness are centered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, you should not—you ought not! What
should I gain, Leslie, by transferring my love to
another? Certainly not a nobler person, a finer face,
a better fortune (if I may name this), a kindlier
heart, or better temper. Believe me, dear Leslie,
when I say you are the handsomest man I ever beheld,
so that no higher degree of personal beauty
could lead me from you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a silly flatterer, child, and I half believe,
fell in love with me because you thought me the
‘handsomest man you ever beheld!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you are mocking me, Leslie. But I will
confess that the first time I saw you promenading
the ball rooms at the —— Assemblies with Miss
P—— on your arm, I was struck with your stately
and elegant walk. I had not seen your face, but followed
you with my eye till you turned and, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Met your gaze full fixed upon mine! That was
not the first time <span class='it'>you</span> had attracted my attention that
evening, Clara. I had observed you on my first entrance,
and my heart from that instant became
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie Pierpoint pressed her to his heart as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall ever be yours, dearest Leslie,” was the
softly whispered response of the blushing girl;
“nothing would turn my love from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you for the pledge, dearest—I believe
you. Come let us return into the rooms—our absence
will be remarked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Leslie had plucked a “Forget me not” and
placed it in her hair, the lovers slowly returned from
the verandah.</p>

<hr class='tbk121'/>

<p class='pindent'>A few weeks passed, and Leslie Pierpoint had prevailed
on the blushing Clara to name the day when
she would redeem her pledge given in the verandah,
and become wholly and irrevocably his own. It was
now at hand, and Leslie counted the hours which envious
Time thrust between him and his anticipated
bliss. Leslie loved the chosen bride of his bosom
with the most impassioned ardor. His whole heart
was involved in his affection, and he had so given
himself up to his passion that any revulsion promised
to make him miserable. The beautiful Clara Clayton,
on her part, was deeply enamored of Leslie, but
it was rather with his handsome person than with
his mind; for of his fortune she thought little, being
equally wealthy. She was a gay, haughty, spoiled
beauty, with not half heart enough to measure Leslie’s
broad love, nor half mind enough to penetrate
the superior powers of his intellect. But if they
married, they were both likely to be happy so long
as one retained her loveliness and the bewitching
smile and flashing dark eyes that had captured Leslie,
and the other the elegant form, air and gait
which had first inspired Clara with an interest in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The week preceding his wedding day Leslie was
commissioned a Major of Militia, and the following
day he turned out for review with the battalion to
which his regiment was attached. He had purchased
a high spirited horse for this occasion, and had but
twice mounted him previous to his appearance on
parade; and though the animal evinced an indomitable
spirit, and had once proven nearly unmanageable,
yet these traits were regarded by the youthful
officer rather as recommendations for the military
service for which he destined him than as serious
objections. He was, moreover, a finished horseman
and well knew he could so control the fiery animal’s
impatient action as to render it subservient to a more
masterly display of his own horsemanship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day of parade, therefore, Leslie Pierpoint
made his appearance on the field, the best mounted
officer in the battalion. His steed, as he pranced
along, seemed to beat the air rather than the earth,
so lightly he moved over the ground, so daintily he
bent his slight yielding fetlocks to his rider’s weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Major, a beautiful creature you have there,”
said General ——, whose aide-de-camp Leslie was
that day; “you outshine us all. What an eye! Will
he stand fire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not tried him, General. But a horse of
his blood has no fear in him. He can never be taken
by surprise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not trust him! See!” and the General suddenly
flashed his sword before his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The animal moved not from the statue-like attitude
in which Leslie had reined him up beside the
General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. He may do; but I advise you, Major
Leslie, to be upon your guard during the day, I don’t
much like the beast’s eye. It looks devilish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no fears, General; let him do his worst,”
answered Leslie laughing, and in a moment afterwards
he galloped along the line to execute an order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the parade the beautiful steed behaved admirably,
and elicited, by the grace and swiftness of
his movements, the universal admiration of every
eye. At length the firing by platoon commenced.
At the first discharge, he leaped bodily into the air
with his rider and lit upon the ground twenty feet
distant; and Leslie’s superior horsemanship only
saved him from being thrown to the earth. He now
sat more firmly and watched him with hand and eye.
But the successive discharges of musketry, even by
companies, had no further effect upon the animal,
save that there was a wider dilation of the pupil of
the eye and a quick erect movement of his delicately
shaped ears. This favorable change not only put
Leslie off his guard but made him so self confident
that he resolved to ride up to a park of artillery
about to be discharged, gaily betting with General
——, as he triumphantly rode past this officer,
that he would not flinch even at that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nous verrons</span>, Leslie,” said the General smiling.
“Do not be too confident.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the reckless impetuosity of youth, and desirous
of defending the character of his favorite horse
from his military friend’s aspersions, Leslie spurred
onward to the point. He drew up in the rear, within
a few paces of the ordnance, and awaited the signal
for their discharge. There were eight pieces of
cannon and they were to be fired in rapid succession.
At the first loud, sharp report, the animal sprung, with
a mad leap, directly among the echoing artillery.
Maddened by the reiterated peals, he dashed, with
the most terrific bounds, across the line of fire and
within a few feet of the muzzles of the pieces. At
the discharge of the last piece he became so terrified
that he threw himself headlong upon the earth and
bit and pawed the ground with fury. Major Leslie,
who had maintained his seat with perfect skill and
coolness, fell beneath him and received his whole
weight upon one of his legs and his left side. Instantly
the animal ceased his struggles, and when
those who hastened to Major Leslie’s assistance arrived
on the spot, they discovered that the horse had
broken a blood vessel and was fast bleeding to death.
Leslie himself, though silent, was pale from suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On extricating him, it was painfully apparent that
his leg was not only broken but that his knee was
crushed. He was immediately removed to his mother’s
residence and the most distinguished surgical
skill called in to his relief. But for many days he
lay upon a bed of anguish during which, Clara, joyfully
embracing the sweet privileges of a betrothed
bride, watched over him like some angelic messenger
of health and peace. At length he was able to
change his recumbent posture for an easy-chair; but
it was many weeks before he left it to attempt to
walk about the chamber. The first time he did so
it was with Dr. M—— on one side and Clara on
the other. It was a painful effort, but two or three
turns about the room were accomplished with less
difficulty than had been apprehended. He walked
very, very lame it is true, but that was to be expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will soon get to his feet again as well as ever,
won’t he, Doctor?” asked Clara, partly to assure her
own anxiety and partly to relieve the foreboding of
poor Leslie, who, by the expression of his face, she
saw, believed he should be lame for life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. M—— looked at Leslie, shook his head sadly
and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will no doubt walk well enough in a few
weeks, Miss Clayton. But then that won’t make
much difference,” he added, smiling, “since he has
no more conquests to make. If you should be lame,
Major, you must regard it a fortunate thing to have
secured so fair a bride while possessing all your
natural attractions of person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, Doctor! you talk as if you thought
there was some possibility that I might be lame for
life. Do tell me if this lameness I now have proceeds
from physical weakness or from imperfection
in the limb?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is cruel to deceive you, my dear Major, though
painful to tell the truth,” answered Dr. M——, after
a pause that did honor to his heart; “your leg was
broken in several places, producing an exceedingly
difficult compound fracture. It is improbable though
not impossible that the parts should ever perfectly
re-unite. I fear, therefore, you must bring both religion
and philosophy to your aid, and try to endure it
cheerfully. This fair being who has so assiduously
nursed by your pillow will help you to bear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie did not look up in the Doctor’s face while
he spoke. His head had fallen upon the arm of his
chair, and there, with his face buried in his hands, he
lay still several minutes after he had ceased to speak.
His chest heaved with suppressed emotion, some
deep o’er-mastering feeling. At length he groaned
heavily and looked up with a faint attempt to smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a hard lot, Doctor, but I must attempt to
bear it as well as I can. I am not unprepared for
this announcement. I have apprehended it myself
from the severe character of the injury I received.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not find it difficult, Major Leslie,” said
the physician, with sympathy in his tone, “to endure
even lameness. Your mind, by several weeks’ previous
illness, is prepared to submit to still greater
suffering if necessary. In illness we bear things, and
take things we could not do in health. Nature prepares
the body and Heaven the mind for all it meets
with on earth. Even death is met quietly and calmly
by the invalid exhausted by a lingering illness. The
idea of lameness if presented to you in full health
would have shocked you. I dare say you would
have unhesitatingly said you preferred death to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have said so and thought so,” answered
Leslie, earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you do not now. On the contrary, you have
just expressed a cheerful submission to your fate.
The same spirit will enable you to endure it with
equanimity. Good morning! I will call in and see
you once a day till you can ride out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kind medical adviser then took his leave, and
for a few moments after his departure the lovers remained
silent. At length Leslie looked up to seek
Clara’s face with a smile as if to tell her that he had
schooled his spirit to submission, with a smile as if
to assure her that so long as he was blessed with her
love he cared not for any misfortune that Providence
should see fit, in its infinite wisdom, to send. But
Clara saw not the smile nor the beautiful submission
expressed on his pale features. Her face was buried
in her hands and turned away from him, while the
heaving of her form and the sobs that broke from her
surcharged heart told how deeply Leslie’s misfortune
sunk into it. He was touched by her violent
grief, and would have risen to approach her, but was
unable to move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clara,” he said, in a low, soothing tone. She
made no reply but continued to be wholly absorbed
in her affliction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest Clara,” he again repeated still more tenderly,
“come hither, and do not give way to grief
in this manner. I care not for it; so, if these tears
are shed for me, dry them and come sit by me. I
assure you, that I would prefer lameness with your
love to fulness and perfection of limb without it.
Come and sit by me and let us converse calmly upon
this subject. It will tranquilize both our minds and
give us strength and patience to bear, as we should
do, an ill seemingly so grievous. In the end it may
prove a blessing. <span class='it'>You</span> ought not to mourn, for it
will ensure to you, as my wife, all my society. I
can name two or three brides,” he added, playfully,
“that would thank Heaven for any accident that
would break their husbands’ legs so that it would
confine them at home with them. Come, Clara,
cheer up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this address from Leslie the lady made no reply
save by increased weeping; and his mother entering
the chamber at the moment, she embraced the opportunity
to excuse herself and hurried from the
room without taking her kerchief from her face, or
even giving her lover look or reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Clara,” he sighed looking after her, “she
feels this affliction most deeply. For myself I could
endure it. Books, friends, and, above all, Clara’s dear
society will make the time pass cheerfully. She will
yet be resigned to it. How strong must be that love
which shows itself by such profound and unextinguishable
sorrow! Ah, mother! have you seen the
Doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear Leslie,” she answered with emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he has told you I shall be lame for life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, my dear child, alas! may Heaven give you
strength and patience to bear this affliction!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has, dear mother. I am perfectly resigned,”
he answered calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you—God be blessed!” and the mother
wept in gratitude upon her son’s neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a few moments’ silence which the invalid
at length broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could bear this affliction, dearest mother, without
a murmur if I stood alone. But, dear Clara!
She weeps as if her heart was breaking. I fear it
will be the death of her—she feels so much for me.
I wish you could convince her that I care nothing
about it if she will not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pierpoint did not reply but shook her head
gravely and sighed very heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What means that sigh, mother?” asked Leslie
with surprise and a misgiving of he knew not what.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, son. But I fear Clara’s tears are devoted
rather to the shrine of her own vanity than
shed upon the altar of her love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How mean you, mother?” demanded Leslie, with
heightened color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clara Clayton, dear boy, loves herself more than
she loves any body else. I have known Clara from
a child. I should never have chosen her as your
wife; but you loved her and there was no alternative
but acquiescence. Though I approved not, I spoke
not, knowing how vain a parent’s words are with
children in affairs of the heart. Clara is proud that
she has captivated the handsomest young man in the
town whom all the young ladies were sighing for;
but she loves you not, Leslie, as a true woman should
love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear mother, how you wrong the angelic
girl! Has she not watched over my sick bed like a
sister, yea, like a beloved and loving wife? Has she
not sympathized in all my afflictions? Did she not
just now quit the chamber overcome by the intensity
of her grief? You wrong her, dear mother, indeed
you wrong her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope I do. Time will determine, my son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why this suspicion? What has Clara done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. I judge from my knowledge of her
character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you do not know her, and have built your
judgment upon a false foundation. Clara is every
thing I wish her to be. Send for her, mother; I
would see her. I will convince you that you are in
error respecting her. But should you be right, <span class='it'>I</span> love
<span class='it'>her</span> and after we are married, as I mean to be in a
few weeks, we shall live very happy together, and in
time I shall teach her to love <span class='it'>me</span> better than she
loves <span class='it'>herself</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pierpoint made no answer and left the room
to seek the fair subject of their conversation. In a
few seconds she returned with a grave look and said
that, leaving word with the footman to say to Mr.
Leslie that she did not feel well, Miss Clayton had
ordered the carriage and driven home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Clara,” said Leslie with sympathy; “she
is herself sick and needs quiet and repose. The
painful announcement of this morning has shocked
her nerves. Mother, why do you look so grave and
sad—so incredulous?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope Miss Clayton had no other motive in so
suddenly departing than indisposition. But, my dear
Leslie, I hope she will prove herself all you hope and
desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of that I am sure, dear mother,” he answered
warmly. “I only grieve that you should have conceived
a prejudice against one who is so soon to become
my wife and your daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us speak no more upon this subject now,
Leslie. You need repose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pierpoint then drew the curtains and darkened
the room. The invalid threw himself back in his
easy-chair and soon, yielding to the soothing influence
of the soft twilight in his chamber, sunk into a
refreshing sleep.</p>

<hr class='tbk122'/>

<p class='pindent'>Clara Clayton sprung from the carriage as it drew
up at her own door, and, without entering the parlor,
hurriedly ascended to her own chamber. Closing the
door, she turned the key in the lock, and then with a
hand each firmly holding a string of her unloosed
hair, and her mantle awry, she paced the room several
minutes with a quick, nervous tread. Her brow
was set and her face much flushed, and the expression
it wore was grief mingled with mortified pride.
Yes, Clara Clayton’s pride was humbled. She had
loved Leslie Pierpoint for his personal beauty—the
elegance of his figure, his high-bred air and carriage,
his manly tread and distinguished appearance in the
street. These first captivated her fancy, and when
at length chance threw them together, his admiration
of her, combined with the excellent qualities of
his head and heart, inspired her with love—love
such as so selfish a person was capable of feeling.
She also felt flattered in the attentions of the handsomest
man of the day; and it was with the triumphant
reflection of how envious some score of her
female rivals would feel that she surrendered her
heart (as much as she had, at least,) to the blinded
Leslie. So their ill-fared love went on, he loving
her with the devotion of idolatry, she loving herself
with no whit less self-adoration. The handsome Leslie
administered to her vanity! It might all have
gone on very well, however, even to matrimony, as
thousands of other similar attachments have done,
<span class='it'>similar</span> save that the cases are more frequently reversed,
and the lover is, instead, the one whose
vanity is administered to by the beauty of the lady!
But the untoward accident that befel Leslie removed
the veil! and often has he blessed his stars for it.
A broken leg is, doubtless, a much less affair than a
broken manly heart!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara Clayton continued to pace her room in vexed
and troubled thought. From what has been said
above, the reader will readily divine its complexion!
Suddenly she stopped and clenched her
jewelled fingers together and wrung them with a
look of pitiable and painful despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, God! lame for life! A <span class='it'>cripple</span>! Miserable!
miserable that I am! How can I love him now?
How can I marry a cripple? Walk Chesnut Street
leaning on a lame husband’s arm—or, no—worse
still, perhaps, he leaning on mine! Think of this
morning as he walked the room! I never saw any
body go lamer! It is absolutely shocking! Then
how can I dance as he cannot! He will never give
nor go to parties! A lame husband! The idea is
absolutely horrid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this praiseworthy and very sensible utterance
of her peculiar feelings on the subject, Miss
Clara Clayton threw her bonnet upon the bed, her
shawl upon the floor and herself into a chair. For
a few seconds she remained silent; at length her
thoughts found their proper language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it must be! I will address him a note this
very morning, stating plainly my reasons why I wish
to withdraw from my engagement with him! He is
too generous to refuse me! He will see at once how
it would break a high-spirited woman full of youth
and beauty to be tied down for life to a sofa and arm-chair—a
mere machine to hand him his crutches
and night-cap! He is too generous to wish it! I
do wish he had not met with this awkward accident.
I don’t think I could have found a better husband
than poor Leslie! But then it is no use to dwell on
this now. I cannot think of marrying him after
what has happened, and he can’t expect—no one can
expect it. I am decided. I will write to him frankly
and request him to release me from my engagement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this determination, this sweet young lady sat
herself down to her escritoire to write poor Leslie’s
sentence of death—death to confidence in woman!
She bent her graceful head over the gilt-edged note
paper, and nibbled her pen several seconds. At length
she began to write:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Here she paused and blushed with something like
shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, this is too cold. I will not offend him.”
And she then took a fair sheet and wrote as follows:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>This address did not suit her. After a few moments’
deliberation she laid a fresh sheet before her
and thus commenced, in a free, decided way, as if
she had fully determined on the mode in which she
should communicate her resolutions to him:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Leslie</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have been surprised, doubtless, at
my sudden departure this morning without seeing
you. To speak frankly and deal truly with you, Dr.
M——’s shocking communication, being so wholly
unexpected and unprepared for, nearly deprived me
of my senses. You are a witness how I was overwhelmed
at the horrid announcement! Unable to
endure the shock, I hastened home without again
seeing you. Since I have been in my own chamber
I have been reflecting upon this fearful destiny in
store for you. Believe me, Leslie, that I would willingly
share it with you if you wished it; but I feel
that you are too generous, too noble to desire to involve
in your own misery the happiness of any
one over whose fate previous circumstances may
have given you the right to exercise a certain kind
of control! Your own knowledge of the world, of
society, will teach you that your recent unhappy
misfortune has placed our relation to each other in
a new light. My happiness now hangs upon your
decision. If you are <span class='it'>really</span> desirous of urging the
ultimate issue of our betrothal, and are willing for
your own selfish ends to wreck the happiness of one
so young as I am, I must <span class='it'>submit</span>; but if, as I feel
you will be, you are, on the other hand, influenced
by those high and generous feelings that distinguish
you above all men, and will freely release me from a
union which it will henceforward be a species of
bondage for me to endure, you will relieve my mind
from a painful weight of anxiety and suspense and
forever secure the <span class='it'>friendship</span> of</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;margin-top:0.25em;'>Yours, sincerely,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Clara Clayton</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The young lady read the letter over carefully
once, sealed, directed, and despatched it without
giving herself time for thought. The street door
closed upon the footman who bore it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is gone! Leslie! alas, poor Leslie! alas, that
Fortune should have driven me to this step! But
there was no alternative. No time for delay. If I
had still visited him I should have been a hypocrite,
and my prolonged absence would have required an
explanation. It was necessary that I should write as
I have. How will Leslie receive it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While she is fancying how the invalid received it,
let us, dear reader, really know how he received it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had slept not quite an hour when his sleep was
disturbed by the ringing of the street-door bell.
Opening his eyes he looked round the chamber and
called in a faint gentle voice—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clara!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no reply and after waiting an instant
he roused himself: “Ah, yes, I had forgotten! She
has returned home. Poor girl! I sympathise with
her in her overwhelming sympathy for me. So I
am to be lame for life! ’Tis a sad, a heavy misfortune!
Ah, mother, I am glad you have come in.
Please draw aside the curtains and let in the light.
It is so gloomy. I have slept well and feel refreshed.
Have you heard from Clara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her footman has just left this note for you, Leslie,”
said Mrs. Pierpoint, putting aside the curtains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give it me, mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie hastily broke the seal, opened it, and ere he
began to read pressed his lips to her name at the
close. Have the kindness to turn back and re-read
the letter, dear reader, with him, that you may enter
into Leslie’s feelings as he perused it. He read to
its close without betraying the least emotion in his
expressive face. But when he had come to the end
he slowly crushed the letter up in his left hand till
the nails of the fingers met through it into the flesh.
His teeth became set and his whole face stern and as
rigid as marble. His alarmed mother caught the
fearful expression of his fixed eyes and flew to him.
He waived her away with a quiet movement of the
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, do not touch me, mother! I am well,
very well;” he said hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dearest child, you are very ill. I will ring
for assistance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—give me a pen—ink—paper too! I
would write.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Doctors have forbidden it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But one—one line, dear mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pierpoint looked at him a moment with hesitation
and then silently obeyed. Not a muscle of
Leslie’s face moved, but it was pale, very pale, as
he took the pen in his fingers. His hand was steady
while he wrote the following brief reply:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mr. Leslie Pierpoint’s compliments to Miss
Clayton—he assures her it is far, far from his
wish, to place an obstacle in the way of her happiness.</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>“<span class='it'>Thursday morning,</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>No. 27— South Sixth St.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He directed and despatched it without a word or
look of emotion; and when the servant had left the
room he calmly turned to his surprised mother,
whose looks were fixed upon him full of anxious inquiry,
smiled faintly upon her and said, at the same
time offering her Clara’s crushed letter,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest mother, you would ask me what this
means? Read this—it will explain—<span class='it'>it is eloquent!</span>
Read it and be so good as never to mention the subject
of it to me again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pierpoint perused it in silence and with tears
of sorrow and sympathy for him whose manly heart
Clara Clayton had crushed as he had crushed the
letter. The mother and the son exchanged glances
and the letter was folded up and laid aside. From
that hour Leslie Pierpoint never breathed the name
of Clara, never looked upon a woman but with secret
dislike and contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that day also he began to mend. On a temper
such as his, treachery, like Clara Clayton’s, must
either be fatally effectual or perfectly harmless.
His haughty and contemptuous spirit did the service
of coat armor in the protection of his heart. It
broke not! It remained whole and manly as ever—but
it strengthened itself in its strength against all
future approaches of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether the soundness of Leslie’s heart extended
itself to his limb or the energy of his proud spirit
exerted a commanding influence over the physical
body cannot be ascertained; but the fact is clear
that he began rapidly to convalesce from the day he
so cavalierly gave Clara her freedom. At the end of
three months thereafter, after having gone through
the regular course of, first, two crutches, then a
crutch and a cane, and then a single crutch alone, he
made his appearance with Dr. M—— on one side
and his only support on the other an ordinary walking
stick! Every where he received the congratulations
of his friends and rejoiced in them; for he
had all along felt a triumphant pride in getting well—a
sort of cherished spirit of revenge, though he
confessed it not to himself, upon Clara—false, heartless
Clara. It is true he walked lame with his cane
and the doctor, but every day he grew better, and at
length his physicians, contrary to their previous decision,
pronounced that the bones of the leg were
properly reunited and that strength in the limb was
only necessary to restore it to its original sound
condition. Tenderly and most gingerly did Leslie
nurse his leg and humor its kindly temper towards
health. Time at length rewarded his care, and at
the end of fourteen months from the time he received
Clara’s letter he walked Chesnut street sound
in limb and with “the lofty carriage, distinguished
air and noble step” that had captivated the fancy
and won the shallow heart of Clara Clayton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie, however, never again looked kindly upon
woman. He believed the sex to be instinctively false-hearted
and selfish; he acknowledged no love in her
but love of herself, and religiously believed that she
married only for self-interest and that she looked
upon men only as instruments for the gratification of
her vanity. No, he never trusted woman from that
time up to the period we have introduced him to the
reader seated in his arm-chair in his library with the
gentle snows of forty-one winters upon his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But time aided by circumstances achieves apparent
impossibilities. Leslie Pierpoint possessed a heart
that would be a treasure to any woman; and because
one had proved traitorous to its noble confidence,
Love had resolved that it should not always be
locked in the ice of winter—that its summer should
come to it again, its seed time and harvest should
return, and fruits and flowers once more bear witness
to the moisture and richness of the long barren soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this change, its progress and extraordinary results,
will form the theme of a Second Tale.</p>

<hr class='tbk123'/>

<div><h1><a id='port'></a>LEAVES FROM A LAWYER’S PORT-FOLIO.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>THE STEP-MOTHER.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I first knew the family of the Wentworths,
it was composed of a husband in the prime of life, a
beautiful being his bride, and a sweet little babe
whom they doted on, not only for its beauty, but as
the heir of his father’s large estates. The family
was noble, or rather its ancestors had been so in
England, and the estates, now in its possession, had
come down from father to son for several generations,
increasing in value with the prosperity of the
country, until they now afforded almost the revenue
of a prince. With the pride of birth, something of
its injustice had attached to the family, for, to maintain
the importance of the name, it had been the
custom, ever since the abolition of primogeniture, to
keep the estate entailed on the eldest son, providing,
however, respectable portions for the other children.
The Wentworth lands had thus descended from the
present proprietor’s father, and were intended to go
down in the same manner to his eldest son. I knew
little of Mr. Wentworth himself, for he was a proud,
reserved man—but his meek wife had early won on
my heart, and from the hour when I was first called
on, as a professional adviser, to give my opinion
respecting some property which she held to her sole
and separate use, under her marriage settlements, up
to the latest moment of her life, my feelings for this
singularly amiable woman, were like those of a parent
to a daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wentworth Hall, where the family resided, was a
large, antique, imposing structure, situated in the
centre of an extensive park, and approached by a
long avenue, terminating at one end in the hall door,
and at the other, at the distance of almost a mile, in
a massy gateway, guarded by a porter’s lodge. The
house, when I first knew it, was as lordly a mansion
as one would wish to see. I passed it the other day,
and it was in ruins. No human being has slept within
its walls since the development of the dreadful
tragedy I am about to relate. God knows I shudder
at the task!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I never saw a sweeter child than the young heir of
Wentworth: I think now I see his little hands, his
silken hair, or his soft blue eyes, so like those of his
mother. All loved him. How could they help it?
for in everything he resembled her who gave him
birth, and she was one who insensibly won every
heart, and deserved to win them too. But in nothing
was this similarity so striking as in the dispositions
of the mother and child. I do not believe
either would knowingly have hurt a fly. Certainly
no traces of the proud irascible temper of the father
could be discovered in the son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well has it been said that the good die young.
They are exhaled, as it were, like dew, back to their
native sky, just at the very time when we begin fully
to appreciate their worth. The young heir was
scarcely three years old when his mother died.
There was grief, and, I believe, heart-felt grief, up
at the old hall for a while,—and then came the intelligence
that Mr. Wentworth had determined to
travel, and that, meanwhile, the young heir was to
be left at home with a nurse, and suitable attendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two years passed away. At length rumors reached
the servants that their master would soon return, accompanied
by a new bride. Before long these reports
were confirmed, and then, after a few days’ delay,
the newly wedded pair dashed up to the hall door
behind a chariot and four, decorated with bride
favors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new comer was certainly a magnificent woman,
but oh! what a contrast to the sweet angel who
had formerly filled her place. The first wife was
rather <span class='it'>petite</span>, with soft blue eyes, and an expression
of countenance almost seraphic; her successor was
a tall, splendid looking woman, with dark flashing
orbs, and a face whose haughty beauty was the very
impersonation of a Juno. I know not why, but
with all her majesty, I never liked the second Mrs.
Wentworth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due time a son was the fruit of this marriage.
The babe, like the mother, was beautiful, and it
seemed to me—it may have been only fancy—that,
in the rejoicings at its birth, the elder son, and undoubted
heir, was totally forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It soon became evident that the new wife was
paramount in her influence over her husband; but,
in one thing she was foiled; she could not alienate
his affections from his elder son. She dared not
openly speak against the young heir, but it was evident
that she hated him, because he would exclude
her own child from the estate; and though the fortune
of a younger son of the Wentworths would
have been an independence to any one else, yet this
grasping woman coveted all for her own darling. On
this point, however, she knew that her husband
would prove inflexible, and that his family pride
would be too strong even for his wife’s persuasions.
She did not, therefore, make the attempt. But in
every possible way, especially when her husband
was absent, she contrived to make the life of her
step-son irksome and intolerable. A thousand petty
vexations, such as are easier felt than described, and
which no one knows so well how to inflict as a
second wife, soured the early life of the young heir,
and, despite his amiable disposition, made him the
most unhappy of beings. The sum of his misery
was filled up, when, his father having been chosen a
member of Congress, left the family at Wentworth
Hall, while he proceeded to Washington. From that
hour, whether at his estate or at the capitol of the
nation, Mr. Wentworth was so occupied by ambition
that he found no time to unravel the domestic transactions
of his household; so that, deprived of the
check heretofore existing on her conduct in the presence
of her husband, the new wife commenced a
more open and oppressive series of petty persecutions
on the young heir, which effectually broke the
spirits of one so delicately constituted. I never saw
a greater change in any one than took place in Herbert
Wentworth between his fifth and eleventh years.
From being used to constant exercise in the open air,
he was restricted to the school-room, the library,
and the garden. In a short time his health gave way,
and he became pale, weakly, and melancholy. And
this was the once gay and happy boy, with a heart
as light as the carol of a bird! Oh! could his
sainted mother have foreseen, on her death-bed, the
destiny that was to overtake her child, how bitter
would have been her parting hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the younger son—the darling of the
mother—was indulged in every thing. His slightest
wish was anticipated. He was taught every manly
accomplishment of the day, and, at twelve, was already
nearly as large as his delicate brother. He
was a skilful horseman, and the best sportsman on
the estates. But he was wilful, passionate and imperious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So matters went on, until the young heir was
nearly eighteen years of age, when his father took
him to Washington with him during the session of
Congress. For the first time emancipated from the
thraldom of his step-mother, Herbert began to be
aware of the importance of his situation, and to become
more than ever averse to the tyranny of his
home. He returned to Wentworth Hall an altered
being. When his father, about this time, received
an appointment to an embassy to one of the South
American States, he solicited to accompany his
parent, but the request could not be granted, and the
young heir was left at home with Mrs. Wentworth
and her son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The change in the character of Herbert soon became
evident to the step-mother. But, in nothing
was it more perceptible than in the resistance the
young heir made to the restraints attempted to be
imposed on him, but from which his brother was exempt.
Privileges which Herbert felt were his,
equally with his brother, or to which he, if either,
had the better right, were no longer surrendered
without expostulation, or in some cases without a
struggle. One of the great causes of difference arose
from the determination, expressed by the young heir,
to shoot on the estate—a privilege no rational being
would have dreamed he was not entitled to—but
which, his pampered brother, habituated to seeing
himself indulged, and Herbert restrained, in everything,
took on himself one day, in a fit of passion, to
dispute. Had Mrs. Wentworth been present, even
she would have seen the folly of her son and would
have checked him; but, unaccustomed to be opposed,
the wilful boy, when he saw his brother with a resolution
as unusual as it was irritating, determined to
insist on the right, flew into a rage, and, in a moment
of phrenzy, presented his gun at Herbert. A scuffle
ensued, in which the piece went off, whether accidentally
or not was never known, and the young heir
fell to the ground weltering in his blood. His life,
for some time, was despaired of, during which time
the brother maintained a sullen silence—but at
length Herbert was declared out of danger, and, in
a few weeks more, was completely restored. During
this time the mother did not hesitate to give that
version of the story which would, by throwing all
the blame on Herbert, exculpate her darling, so that,
when the young heir left his sick chamber, he found
that, except among a few who knew his disposition
better, he was received as an arrogant, and quarrelsome
young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This incident, however, had exercised a powerful
influence on Mrs. Wentworth. The very fact that
Herbert, whom she and her son had so long ruled
with a rod of iron, should attempt to break loose
from the thraldom, inflamed her almost to madness.
From envying, she began to hate the young heir, and
that too with a deadliness of which one would have
thought her incapable. And every day, as Herbert
broke some new mesh of the net in which she had
involved him, she learned to hate him more passionately
than before. Indeed, to a woman of her disposition,
nothing could be more galling than to see one,
over whom she had been used to tyrannize at her
pleasure, asserting his rights, even, in some cases,
in direct contradiction to her commands, as, for instance,
when Herbert refused, as heir to the estate,
to allow some wood to be cut down which she had
ordered to be felled and sold. I solemnly believe
that the haughty step-mother never forgave this act—that
the remembrance of it haunted her night and
day—and that it filled up the cup of hatred, which
before was well nigh full, and led to the dreadful catastrophe
which ensued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said the young heir recovered from his
wound, but he remained in an exceedingly delicate
state of health, so that the least exposure of his person
was sure to bring on a cold, attended with pains
in his side, at the seat of the wound. However, by
clothing carefully according to the weather, he succeeded,
in the course of some six months, in firmly,
as he thought, re-establishing his health, though, it
is my firm conviction, that, from the hour of his
wound, his constitution was effectually undermined.
Certain it is, that when Herbert, thinking himself
perfectly restored, ventured one day on a little more
exposure than usual, he was seized with a violent
cold, which soon resulted in a fever of the most desperate
character. So fatal were the ravages of the
disease that his life was soon despaired of, and for
several days we hourly expected to hear of his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this crisis, what were the feelings of the
haughty step-mother? She could not be expected to
wish for the recovery of the being whom she hated
with such intensity, and, although she was forced to
appear concerned for him, and the best medical attendance
was, by her orders, procured, yet I have
not the least doubt that the one burning wish of her
heart, during all that terrible time, was that the
young heir might never recover. His death, indeed,
would be the consummation of all her hopes. It
would, at once, place her darling son in possession of
the vast estates of his father—a position at which
she could not look without a momentary bewilderment.
As day after day elapsed, and the young heir
grew weaker and weaker, her hopes rose in proportion,
and the prize on which, at first, she had scarcely
ventured to look, she now regarded as almost in the
possession of her child. How her heart leaped—we
will not attempt to disguise it—at the prospect
before her. She would be removed from all fear of
the interference of Herbert—she would be saved
from the shame of being thwarted as she had been—she
would no longer have a right to remain at the
Hall only as long as her husband lived; and though,
under other circumstances, she felt she might have
continued in it to her dying day, yet she knew that
Herbert, after what had passed, would, on his
father’s death, cut off all communication with her.
Besides her pride revolted from accepting a favor at
the hands of the young heir. Her own child too!
brought up as he had been, with habits of such lavish
expenditure, how would he ever be able to live on
the fortune, handsome though it was, reserved for the
younger son of the house of Wentworth. He had
been used to every indulgence; he had been taught
to regard everybody and everything as subservient to
his wishes; in short, he had been educated as the
heir rather than as the younger son of the family—and
now, when the vast estates of his father were
almost within his grasp, when only the life of a
sickly boy was in his way, could his mother be expected
to look on the death of the real heir with any
thing but complacency? But she dissembled her
feelings: the world gave her credit for the most
poignant anguish of mind during the vacillations of
the disease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how is the patient to-night, doctor,” said
she, following the physician out of the sick chamber,
and affecting to place her handkerchief to her eyes;
“do you not think he is a little, a very little improved?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not wish, unnecessarily, to alarm you,”
was the answer; “indeed, you must have seen the
ravages of the disease; but so far from thinking
your son”—oh! how the word grated on her feelings—“any
better, I fear he cannot survive until
morning. He is not naturally of a strong constitution,
and this fever would have brought the stoutest
man to the grave. I wonder how young Mr. Wentworth
has withstood it so long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you cannot give us any hope. Oh! cannot
you let us have some, even the slightest, expectation
of his recovery? Do, dear Doctor, only say a word
like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician shook his head sadly, for he had
become attached to his patient, and knew nothing of
the secret of his companion’s heart—and departed.
The unnatural woman turned to her chamber, and,
with a joy we will not attempt to picture, paced up
and down the room. At length, she thought her
wishes were about to be fulfilled; her boy, her darling
boy, would inherit the broad lands she saw from
her casement; and she!—she paused, and muttered—“ah!
there will be a vast difference betwixt the
mere widow of the proprietor of Wentworth Hall,
and the mother of that personage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a short time she calmed her transports, and, returning
to the bed-side of the now insensible sufferer,
watched there until late at night, when she retired,
with apparent reluctance, leaving orders, however,
to be called should any change be perceptible in the
patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had fallen into an uneasy sleep, in which a
thousand wild dreams flitted through her mind, and
the clock had just struck the second hour after her
retirement, when a maid-servant knocked at her
chamber door, and saying, that her young master
had suddenly awoke sane, and had conversed rationally
with the nurse, departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is going, then,” muttered the unnatural woman,
in a delirium of joy; “they always are so just
before death;” and hastily throwing on a loose dress,
she hurried to the room of the sufferer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curtains were closed when she entered, and
the nurse held up her finger, whispering—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has just fallen asleep. Praise to God, the
crisis is past, and the dear youth will recover! His
fever has left him—his skin is no longer hot—he is
free from delirium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words of the faithful old creature almost took
away Mrs. Wentworth’s breath; she felt herself
turning pale, and her brain swam around. Happily,
the room was imperfectly lighted, so that the nurse
could not detect the changes in the countenance of
her mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>And is there any fear of a relapse?</span>” said Mrs.
Wentworth, forcing herself to assume feelings, outwardly,
far different from those really raging in her
bosom. “Is the <span class='it'>dear boy</span> safe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The chances are infinitely in his favor; yet there
is a possibility of a relapse. I pray God no such
evil may overtake Master Herbert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mistress nodded, and feeling that she could not
much longer maintain her composure, she said that
she would return to her room for a moment to procure
her slippers, when she would aid her in watching
by the sick bed, as she was <span class='it'>too overjoyed to
sleep</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What pen can paint her feelings when she reached
her chamber? Here were all her bright visions dissipated.
The prospect before her was darker than
ever. What would become of herself after her husband’s
death?—what, indeed, would that husband
say when he returned and heard Herbert’s version of
his brother’s and her conduct? What would become
of her darling son, subject, perhaps, to his father’s
displeasure, and, at most, left with nothing but a
younger son’s fortune, with which to support his expensive
habits? She paused in the centre of her
room. A thousand furies seemed agitating her countenance.
Pride, fear, hate, all chased each other, by
turns, through her bosom. Suddenly her face assumed
a look of comparative calmness. She walked
to a neighboring closet, took from its wall a small
phial, and then, gazing a moment at her face in the
glass, she placed her slippers on her feet, and sought
the room of the invalid. Motioning to the nurse to
keep her seat, this fearful woman crossed to the other
side of the bed, and sat down by the little table on
which stood the medicine for the sufferer. The cup
already contained the dose which was to be given
him at the expiration of the hour. She looked at the
watch—but a few minutes remained to the time.
She looked around the room—no one was in it but
the nurse, who was concealed by the curtains of the
bed. She hastily uncorked the phial, and, with a
trembling hand, let fall a few drops of the liquid it
contained into the cup. The phial was then secreted,
and, with a face as ashy as the dead, she heard, the
next instant, the clock strike the hour. The patient
awoke at the noise, and, almost on the instant, the
nurse came around and took the cup in her hand.
My pen trembles so I can scarcely proceed—but I
must. Suffice it to say the cup was drained, and the
invalid, as if exhausted, sank back on his pillow.
When next the attendant drew aside the curtain, she
gazed on the face of the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me escape from this terrible tragedy. The
young heir was buried in lordly state, and no suspicion
ever arose that he died otherwise than by a
sudden relapse. But was Mrs. Wentworth happy?
She saw her son the acknowledged heir of the estate,
and for this she had labored her whole life—but was
she happy? I will answer, in the words of Scripture,
when speaking of the wicked—“Terrors take
hold on him as waters; the tempest swalloweth him
up in the night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>For God shall cast upon him and
not spare.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passed. Even Mrs. Wentworth began to
find, in the lapse of years, and in gazing on her son,
now near eighteen, some alleviation for her tortured
mind. But God, whose inscrutable Providence had
hitherto seemed to forget the unholy deed we have
just narrated, was now preparing for its author a
fearful retribution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was just five years from the day of Herbert’s
death, when the doating mother was standing in the
door of her house, surrounded by a party of visitors
of her own age, waiting for the approach of a gay
cavalcade of young people, coming up the avenue.
The sky was gloomy and threatened a storm, and
the riders were evidently returning in haste. But
the tempest was quicker than even their fleet steeds,
and the group, with young Wentworth at its head,
was yet some distance from the door, when the storm
burst on the riders. Each put spurs to his horse, and
the young heir, as wilful as ever, instead of awaiting
his companions, dashed forward as fast as his steed—the
fleetest of them all—could carry him. He was
already several rods in advance of his companions,
when the wind, suddenly bursting out into a hurricane,
swept across the avenue, taking in its course a
huge, but somewhat decayed tree, whose trunk, after
swaying forwards a moment, was seen to yield to the
gale just as young Wentworth came underneath it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out!” shouted those who saw the danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save him!—oh! save him!” shrieked the mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was too late. Down, with a crash like thunder,
came the gigantic tree, the trunk striking the unhappy
youth right on the head, and bearing him to the
earth as if he was a mere twig. There was a wild
cry, and all that remained of the victim was one
quivering hand, extended, as if in supplication, beyond
the trunk of the tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spectators stood aghast, transfixed with
speechless horror, at the fearful sight. A deathlike
stillness of a moment, and only of a moment, followed.
It was broken by a long, wild, harrowing
shriek of anguish, at the remembrance of which,
even now, my blood runs cold. They all turned instinctively
in the same direction—towards the mother
of the victim—for that shriek could have come
from no one else. They saw her fall like marble to
the earth. They sprang to her side. Her eyes were
wide open, glaring fearfully on vacancy—the foam
had gathered, thick and white, on her bloodless lips—her
whole frame was quivering in an agony such as—thank
God!—mortal man has rarely seen. There
she lay, struck by the hand of God, writhing in convulsions.
Tell me not there is no retribution! Oh!
fearfully was that murdered boy avenged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took her up, bore her into her stately chamber,
and despatched messengers on every hand for
medical aid. All that the skill of the profession
could do to restore her was exerted, but for a long
time unsuccessfully. At length, however, Mrs.
Wentworth showed signs of recovery. Slowly, consciousness
appeared to return to her; but just when
her attendants were beginning to hope that the danger
had passed, she sprang up in her bed, and, placing
her hands before her eyes, shrieked, “save him—save
him—oh, God! have mercy—I am the murderer—he
is innocent,” and with other ejaculations,
equally as terrific, she sank down on the couch, in a
paroxysm of madness. <span class='it'>She was a maniac.</span> It was
not many days before nature gave way beneath the
struggle, but, during the ravings of her phrenzy, she
recapitulated the whole of the dreadful tragedy, and
in words too that made her listeners tremble to hear.
It has often occurred to me, that, if the death-bed
revelations of but one year could be made public, they
would make us avoid our fellow-men as beings of a
darker world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One word and this melancholy leaf is ended. Mr.
Wentworth never returned from his mission, but fell
a victim to the climate of South America. His
estate having been entailed to the issue of his own
body, of course, failing such issue, passed in the
regular course of succession; and descending to
nearly a score of collateral heirs, who divided the
property betwixt them, was soon broken into fragments.
The old Hall was shunned with superstitious
fear, and is now in ruins. So pass away the things
of this world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no piety like that in our cottages. Go
through the land from one end to the other,—enter,
if you will, at every door you pass,—seek out the
dying in lordly hall, and lowly dwelling,—and you
will find that the humble tenants of the humblest
roof, are often the most acceptable in the eyes of
their Maker, and that in the words of Holy Writ,
“not many wise, not many noble are called,” but
“God hath chosen the weak things of this world to
confound the mighty.” And there is a philosophy in
this. The rich have wherewithal to enjoy themselves
in this life, and what care they for the one to come?
but the poor find no peace from toil on earth, and
gladly hail the message which bids them to a better
and a brighter world, where “the weary are at rest.”
Then, too, the Sabbath of the cottager! They who
live in cities, or dwell in stately palaces in the country,
have no idea of the soothing calm, of this day,
to the poor man. All through the weary week, in
summer or in winter, amid cold and rain and heat, he
is compelled to toil for the scanty pittance which
barely keeps his wife and little ones alive—and
when the Sabbath morning comes, and he sees all so
tidy about him, while the sun smiles pleasantly
through the casement, and there is an eloquent stillness
on all without, a feeling of freedom and of untold
peace, comes stealing over his soul, such as
those who have never shared his toils cannot imagine.
If he has a heart it is melted into gratitude. If he is
a godly man—and do not these very things purify
his heart insensibly?—he will call his little ones
around him, and, together, they will lift up their
thanksgivings for the blessings of another week. Oh!
how often—in some old country house, far, far away
from the crimes and cares of the town—have we
listened to the morning hymn, sweetly rising on the
air, and seeming to go up to heaven all the sweeter
for the songs of birds and the murmurs of the stream,
with which it mingled. Yes! we love</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yonder is a cottage, down in the glen. If you will
come and stand with us beside the casement, you can
just see the white walls of that humble home, smiling
through the embowering foliage. There live a
daughter and her parents, and if you would see piety,
go into that cottage. Shall I tell you how their Sunday
is spent? It will be a lesson to us all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When breakfast is over, the little family, attired
in their best, set forth to church, the daughter walking
betwixt her aged parents, and kindly supporting
their steps, while every thing around them soothes
their hearts for the duties of the day. It is a September
morning, and all Nature is filled with harmony.
Not a leaf that rustles on the air, nor a brook
that babbles by, nor a bird that whistles in the wood,
nor the voice of a child singing from the overflowing
gladness of its heart, but is sweeter to their ear, and
more soothing to their souls, than the music of a
Garcia. And when they reach the old church how
every one will make room for them! And so, after
service, will they return home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in the afternoon, they will gather around the
little table, beneath the open casement, through
which float gently the hum of bees and the fragrance
of flowers, and there they will sit, listening to the
word of God, as their daughter reads it aloud. There
is such a quiet, a soft dreamy quiet around, that it
soothes them insensibly to a holy calm. The very
clock seems to tick less audibly; the cat sits purring
in her lowest tone; the bird, from his cage, looks
silently down; the sunbeams fall hushed on the
clean, bright floor; and the rose-leaves by the window,
that now and then float to the ground, strike
with a faint low sound on the earth, like the foot-fall
of a fairy at moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every word of that sacred volume the listeners
drink in eagerly, for are they not “athirst for the
waters of life?” Aye! they drink it in the more
eagerly because read by her, whose voice, to them,
is softer than that of a cherub.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And such is Cottage Piety. The proud may sneer
at it—the rich may regard it as a fiction—the
dwellers in town may look on it as an enthusiast’s
picture; but the great God who made us all, and
who notes every deed, beholds thousands of such
scenes, every Sabbath of the year.</p>

<hr class='tbk126'/>

<div><h1><a id='spor'></a>Sports and Pastimes.—THE FOWLING-PIECE.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Before making choice of a gun, the sportsman should determine
what weight he can conveniently carry. The heaviest
gun, as regards shooting, will be most effective; but
he should recollect, that unless he be a very robust person,
a light gun will on the whole bring him more game, as a few
pounds in the weight makes a deal of difference in the distance
the person can carry it with ease, and few persons can
shoot well when fatigued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most approved guns under the system which prescribes
a heavy charge of powder and a light one of shot,
are double-barrels, bearing the following relative proportions
of length to calibre:<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>—fourteen gauge, thirty-four
inches long; seventeen gauge, thirty-two inches long;
twenty gauge, thirty inches long. For the shooter who
never uses shot larger than No. 6 or 7, these are proper proportions;
and did the guns weigh nine or ten pounds each,
they would shoot No. 6 or 7 shot well. But when under
seven pounds and a half, which is the heaviest gun we
should think of using in hot weather, or for a long day’s
woodcock shooting, they do not throw small shot as effectively
as a short gun throws large shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barrels twenty-eight inches long, and fourteen, sixteen, or
eighteen gauge, are of convenient size for a gun not exceeding
seven pounds and a half. Those of eighteen gauge shoot
shot well; but those of fourteen throw a cartridge more
satisfactorily. Sixteen is a desirable medium. These barrels
are as efficient as long ones for short distances, viz.
under thirty yards; and nine tenths of game brought to the
bag is killed within that distance. And for making long
shots, the wire cartridge has obviated the necessity of using
long guns. A short gun, of the same weight as a long one,
is much less tiresome to carry. A pound additional weight
at the breech is not so fatiguing to the arm as half that
weight added to the end of the barrel; it is the top-heavy
gun that distresses the shooter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking the season throughout, we are convinced that the
most effective gun is a short light one, for which our standard
charge is 1-5/8 drachm, or the tenth part of an ounce of
powder, and 2 oz. of No. 2 shot, containing 220 pellets.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> But
when game is wild, we would charge the reserve barrel, and
on some occasions both barrels, with nearly double the above
quantity of powder, and a No. 5 cartridge for winter partridge
shooting in an open country, or with a No. 4 or 5 cartridge
for grouse shooting. No. 7 is best for snipe shooting.
Small shot may be used for partridge shooting in September,
though we do not see any reason for not adhering to No. 2,
except that birds very near the gun are liable to be more disfigured
by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All guns of the same weight require nearly the same
weight and proportions of powder and shot. Unless they
are bored with an unusual degree of relief or friction, a difference
in size of the bore, or in the length of the barrel,
renders less variation in charging necessary than is generally
supposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The different proportions of powder and shot must be
regulated chiefly by the weight of the gun and the size of the
shot used. The following may be about the proper proportions
for the generality of guns not exceeding seven pounds
and a half.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>These proportions cannot be materially deviated from
without destroying the effect. If the powder is decreased,
the discharge is weakened; if the powder is increased, the
shot spreads; if the weight of the charge of shot is decreased,
there will not be a sufficient number of pellets for effective
shooting; if the weight of the charge of shot is increased,
the discharge is weakened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The usual objection to large shot is, that after it has travelled
thirty yards it becomes dispersed; but let the powder
be reduced to 1½ drachm, and that objection fails. If it is
not overcharged with powder, a light gun will shoot No. 2
shot close enough to bring down game with more certainty,
at thirty or forty yards’ distance, than if charged with small
shot and two or three drachms of powder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As few sportsmen ever tried so small a charge of powder
as 1½ drachm with so heavy a charge of shot as 2 oz., or as
large size as No. 2, we invite a trial of the experiment we
are about to suggest, with any gun that may happen to be in
their possession, <span class='it'>not weighing more than</span> 7½ lb. With the
above proportions of powder and shot—the shot being
oiled—let the shooter fire at forty yards, with good elevation,
because large shot droops more than small, at an unbound
book nailed to a wall, with an open newspaper
(double sheet) spread in front of it. And afterwards let him
charge the <span class='it'>same</span> gun with No. 6 or 7 shot, and any variation
of the relative proportions of powder and shot that his fancy
may suggest, and fire at a similar target. The newspaper
will prove that the large shot is carried with sufficient closeness;
and the book will show which broadside would have
told the best on a grouse. On opening the book, the large
shot will be found to have penetrated farther, and the leaves
will be bulged in beyond it.</p>

<div><h1><a id='rev'></a>REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS.</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Joseph Rushbrook, or the Poacher.</span> By <span class='sc'>Captain Marryatt</span>,
<span class='it'>Author of Peter Simple</span>, <span class='it'>Jacob Faithful</span>, etc. etc.
<span class='it'>Two Volumes. Philadelphia: Carey and Hart.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It has been well said that “the success of certain works
may be traced to sympathy between the author’s mediocrity
of ideas, and mediocrity of ideas on the part of the public.”
In commenting on this passage, Mrs. Gore, herself a shrewd
philosopher, observes that, whether as regards men or
books, there exists an excellence too excellent for general
favor. To “make a hit”—to captivate the public eye,
ear, or understanding without a certain degree of merit—is
impossible; but the “hardest hit” is seldom made, indeed
we may say <span class='it'>never</span> made, by the highest merit. When
we wrote the word <span class='it'>seldom</span> we were thinking of Dickens and
the “Curiosity Shop,” a work unquestionably of “the highest
merit,” and which at a first glance appears to have made
the most unequivocal of “hits”—but we suddenly remembered
that the compositions called “Harry Lorrequer” and
“Charles O’Malley” had borne the palm from “The Curiosity
Shop” in point of what is properly termed <span class='it'>popularity</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There can be no question, we think, that the philosophy
of all this <span class='it'>is</span> to be found in the apothegm with which we
began. Marryatt is a singular instance of its truth. He has
always been a very <span class='it'>popular</span> writer in the most rigorous
sense of the word. His books are essentially “mediocre.”
His ideas are the common property of the mob, and have
been their common property time out of mind. We look
throughout his writings in vain for the slightest indication
of originality—for the faintest incentive to thought. His
plots, his language, his opinions are neither adapted nor intended
for scrutiny. We must be contented with them as
sentiments, rather than as ideas; and properly to estimate
them, even in this view, we must bring ourselves into a
sort of identification with the sentiment of the mass. Works
composed in this spirit are sometimes purposely so composed
by men of superior intelligence, and here we call to
mind the <span class='it'>Chansons</span> of Béranger. But usually they are the
natural exponent of the vulgar thought in the person of a
vulgar thinker. In either case they claim for themselves
<span class='it'>that</span> which, for want of a more definite expression, has been
called by critics <span class='it'>nationality</span>. Whether this nationality in
letters is a fit object for high-minded ambition, we cannot
here pause to inquire. If it is, then Captain Marryatt occupies
a more desirable position than, in our heart, we are
willing to award him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joseph Rushbrook” is not a book with which the critic
should occupy many paragraphs. It is not very dissimilar
to “Poor Jack,” which latter is, perhaps, the best specimen
of its author’s cast of thought, and <span class='it'>national</span> manner, although
inferior in interest to “Peter Simple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plot can only please those who swallow the probabilities
of “Sinbad the Sailor,” or “Jack and the Bean-Stalk”—or
we should have said, more strictly, the incidents;
for of plot, properly speaking, there is none at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph Rushbrook is an English soldier who, having long
served his country and received a wound in the head, is
pensioned and discharged. He becomes a poacher, and
educates his son (the hero of the tale and also named Joseph)
to the same profession. A pedler, called Byres, is about to
betray the father, who avenges himself by shooting him.
The son takes the burden of the crime upon himself, and
flees the country. A reward is offered for his apprehension—a
reward which one Furness, a schoolmaster, is very
anxious to obtain. This Furness dogs the footsteps of our
hero, much as Fagin, the Jew, dogs those of Oliver Twist,
forcing him to quit place after place, just as he begins to
get comfortably settled. In thus roaming about, little Joseph
meets with all kinds of outrageously improbable adventures;
and not only this, but the reader is bored to death with the
outrageously improbable adventures of every one with
whom little Joseph comes in contact. Good fortune absolutely
besets him. Money falls at his feet wherever he
goes, and he has only to stoop and pick it up. At length he
arrives at the height of prosperity, and thinks he is entirely
rid of Furness, when Furness re-appears. That Joseph
should, in the end, be brought to trial for the pedler’s murder
is so clearly the author’s design, that he who runs may
read it, and we naturally suppose that his persecutor, Furness,
is to be the instrument of this evil. We suppose also,
of course, that in bringing this misfortune upon our hero,
the schoolmaster will involve himself in ruin, in accordance
with the common ideas of poetical justice. But no;—Furness,
being found in the way, is killed off, accidentally,
having lived and plotted to no ostensible purpose, through
the better half of the book. Circumstances that have
nothing to do with the story involve Joseph in his trial. He
refuses to divulge the real secret of the murder, and is sentenced
to transportation. The elder Rushbrook, in the
meantime, has avoided suspicion and fallen heir to a great
property. Just as his son is about to be sent across the
water, some of Joe’s friends discover the true state of
affairs, and obtain from the father, who is now conveniently
upon his death-bed, a confession of his guilt. Thus all ends
well—if the word <span class='it'>well</span> can be applied in any sense to trash
so ineffable—the father dies, the son is released, inherits
the estate, marries his lady-love, and prospers in every
possible and impossible way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have mentioned the imitation of Fagin. A second
plagiarism is feebly attempted in the character of one
Nancy, a trull, who is based upon the Nancy of Oliver
Twist—for Marryatt is not often at the trouble of diversifying
his thefts. This Nancy changes her name three or four
times, and so in fact do each and all of the <span class='it'>dramatis personæ</span>.
This changing of name is one of the bright ideas
with which the author of “Peter Simple” is most pertinaciously
afflicted. We would not be bound to say how many
aliases are borne by the hero in this instance—some dozen
perhaps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The novels of Marryatt—his later ones at least—are
evidently written to order, for certain considerations, and
have to be delivered within certain periods. He thus finds
it his interest to <span class='it'>push on</span>. Now, for this mode of progress,
<span class='it'>incident</span> is the sole thing which answers. One incident
begets another, and so on <span class='it'>ad infinitum</span>. There is never the
slightest necessity for pausing; especially where no plot is
to be cared for. <span class='it'>Comment</span>, in the author’s own person, upon
what is transacting, is left entirely out of question. There
is thus none of that <span class='it'>binding</span> power perceptible, which often
gives a species of unity (the unity of the writer’s individual
thought) to the most random narrations. All works composed
as we have stated Marryatt’s to be composed, will be
run on, <span class='it'>incidentally</span>, in the manner described; and, notwithstanding
that it would seem at first sight to be otherwise,
yet it is true that no works are so insufferably tedious.
These are the novels which we read with a hurry exactly
consonant and proportionate with that in which they were
indited. We seldom leave them unfinished, yet we labor
through to the end, and reach it with unalloyed pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>commenting</span> force can never be safely disregarded. It
is far better to have a dearth of incident, with skilful observations
upon it, than the utmost variety of event, without.
In some previous review we have observed (and our observation
is borne out by analysis), that it was the deep sense
of the want of this binding and commenting power, in the
old Greek drama, which gave rise to the chorus. The
chorus came at length to supply, in some measure, a deficiency
which is inseparable from dramatic action, and
represented the expression of <span class='it'>the public</span> interest or sympathy
in the matters transacted. The successful novelist
must, in the same manner, be careful to bring into view his
<span class='it'>private</span> interest, sympathy, and opinion, in regard to his
own creations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have spoken of “The Poacher” at greater length
than we intended; for it deserves little more than an announcement.
It has the merit of a homely and not unnatural
simplicity of style, and is not destitute of pathos: but this is
all. Its English is excessively slovenly. Its events are
monstrously improbable. There is no adaptation of parts
about it. The truth is, it is a pitiable production. There
are twenty young men of our acquaintance who make no
pretension to literary ability, yet who could produce a
better book <span class='it'>in a week</span>.</p>

<hr class='tbk128'/>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Life of Petrarch.</span> By <span class='sc'>Thomas Campbell, Esq.</span>, <span class='it'>Author
of The Pleasures of Hope</span>, etc. etc. <span class='it'>Complete in one
volume. Philadelphia: Carey and Hart.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We are not among those who regard the genius of Petrarch
as a subject for enthusiastic admiration. The characteristics
of his poetry are not traits of the highest, or even
of a high order; and in accounting for his fame, the discriminating
critic will look rather to the circumstances which
surrounded the man, than to the literary merits of the pertinacious
sonnetteer. Grace and tenderness we grant him—but
these qualities are surely insufficient to establish his
poetical apotheosis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other respects he is entitled to high consideration. As
a patriot, notwithstanding some accusations which have
been rather urged than established, we can only regard him
with approval. In his republican principles; in his support
of Rienzi at the risk of the displeasure of the Colonna
family; in his whole political conduct, in short, he seems to
have been nobly and disinterestedly zealous for the welfare
of his country. But Petrarch is most important when we
look upon him as the bridge by which, over the dark gulf
of the middle ages, the knowledge of the old world made its
passage into the new. His influence on what is termed the
revival of letters was, perhaps, greater than that of any man
who ever lived; certainly far greater than that of any of his
immediate contemporaries. His ardent zeal in recovering
and transcribing the lost treasures of antique lore cannot be
too highly appreciated. But for him, many of our most
valued classics might have been numbered with Pindar’s
hymns and dithyrambics. He devoted days and nights to this
labor of love; snatching numerous precious books from the
very brink of oblivion. His judgment in these things was
strikingly correct, while his erudition, for the age in which
he lived, and for the opportunities he enjoyed, has always
been a subject of surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the whole, therefore, it is not so very wonderful that
Petrarch has had many biographers. Much, to be sure, of
the excessive comment upon his character may be traced to
the generating influence of biography in itself. One life as
surely begets another as a sum at compound interest doubles
itself in a certain space of time. Each personal friend of
the hero is anxious to prove a stricter intimacy with him
than that enjoyed by the personal friend who wrote before.
Contemporary contradictions thus arise, which it is left for
posterity to reconcile. In the private library of the French
King, at the Louvre, there exists a <span class='it'>Petrarchian Library</span>,
consisting of nine hundred volumes illustrative of the life of
the poet. It was collected by Professor Marsand of Padua,
and a quarto catalogue of it was, not many years ago, published
at Milan. The <span class='it'>best</span> biography of Petrarch, after the
one which now lies before us, is no doubt that of the Abbé
de Sade. This prelate, proud of a descent from Laura, consumed
the greater part of his life in toilsome journeys, seeking
material for a life of her lover. He was unquestionably
the most accomplished foreigner who wrote on the affairs of
Italy in the fourteenth century. His account of Petrarch
has been made the chief basis of Mr. Campbell’s present
work. We are sorry to see, moreover, that the author of
“The Pleasures of Hope” has followed his authority even
in the matter of wholesale vituperation of all previous writers
upon the subject. De Sade abuses the whole Italian nation,
accusing it, <span class='it'>en masse</span>, of gross ignorance in respect to our
poet. Mr. Campbell abuses the whole Italian nation and De
Sade. Not only this, but he is at great pains to be bitter
upon Archdeacon Coxe, who had bequeathed to the Library
of the British Museum a MS. Life of Petrarch. Of this MS.
Mr. Colburn, it seems, caused a copy to be taken, and, intending
it for publication, requested Mr. Campbell to act as
editor. Mr. C. consented, “surrounded himself with as
many books connected with the subject as he could obtain,
and applied assiduously to the study of Italian literature,
which he had neglected for many years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having done all this, our editor sat down to his task of arrangement
and revision. But the Coxe-Petrarchan MSS.
appear to have defied his powers. “If any one” says he,
“suspects me of dealing unfairly with the Archdeacon, let
him go to the Library of the British Museum and peruse the
work in question—his skepticism will find its reward. He
will agree with me that the Coxeian MS. is placed in a
wrong part of the Museum. It should not be in the library,
but among the bottled abortions of anatomy, or the wooden
visages of the South Sea idols.” Mr. Campbell’s kind offer
of permitting any skeptic to satisfy himself by going to the
Museum and “<span class='it'>perusing</span>” a huge book which he has just
declared to be unfit for perusal, puts us much in mind of
the candor of the Munchausens and Ferdinand Mendez
Pintos, who, telling incredible tales of lands at the South
Pole or mountains in the moon, confound all doubters with
a request to proceed and satisfy themselves by personal inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing is certainly <span class='it'>very</span> strange:—that Mr. Campbell
did not think of looking at “the Coxe-Petrarchan MS.” in
the first place—in the beginning of things—before “surrounding
himself with as many books as he could obtain,”
and especially before “applying himself assiduously to the
study of Italian literature, which he had neglected for many
years.” He would have saved himself much trouble, and
the Archdeacon might have been spared some abuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What particularly surprises us in this volume—a large
and handsomely printed octavo—is <span class='it'>its slovenliness of
style</span>. Such a charge as this has never before been urged
against the author of “Hohenlinden.” In general he is scrupulously
correct. The Archdeacon seems to have bewildered
his brains in unsettling his temper. What are we to
make of such phraseology as this, occurring in the very
second sentence of the work?—“It was known that the
Rev. Archdeacon Coxe had bequeathed to the Library of the
British Museum a MS. Life of the Poet which <span class='it'>he</span> had written.”
Here “<span class='it'>he</span>” implies the Poet, but is intended to imply
the Archdeacon. Such misconstructions are abundant.
We observe, also, far more serious defects—defects of <span class='it'>tone</span>.
These sentences, for instance, are in shockingly bad taste—“The
most skilful physicians stood aghast at this disease,
(the plague.) The charlatan rejoiced at it, <span class='it'>unless it attacked
himself</span>, because it put quackery on a par with skill;
and compassionate women <span class='it'>assisted both physicians and
quacks in doing no good to their patients ... This was a
dance of the king of terrors over the earth, and a very
rapid one.</span>” Attempts at humor on such subjects are always
exceedingly <span class='it'>low</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor can the general handling of the theme of the book be
said to be well done. The biographer has swallowed the
philosopher. While we are sometimes interested in personal
details, we more frequently regret the want of a comprehensive
analysis of the poet’s character, and of the age
in which he lived. The book has no doubt filled, in a certain
unsatisfactory manner, a blank in our biographical literature—since
the authorities referred to can scarcely be
termed accessible—but, upon the whole, it is unworthy
Thomas Campbell—still less is it worthy Petrarch. We
cannot say with Crébillon—</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Idler in France.</span> By the <span class='sc'>Countess of Blessington</span>.
<span class='it'>Two Volumes. Philadelphia: Carey and Hart.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Countess of Blessington has never risen in any of
her literary attempts above the merit of an amusing gossiper;
and “The Idler in France” is an excellent gossiping
book, and no more. Still, this is saying a good deal for it as
times go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work is made up of adventures, reminiscences,
trumpery philosophy, criticism in a small way, scandal, and
heterogeneous chit-chat—the whole interwoven, in the
most random manner conceivable, into an account of a tour
in France made many years ago by her ladyship. “Patch
Work” is a title which would have exactly suited the
volumes, and it is a pity that Captain Hall has anticipated it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The anecdotes, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, are by no means confined to
France, but often relate to things in general, happening in
no particular place. Throughout, there is much vivacity
and no little amusement. Some of the scandal, if not <span class='it'>nice</span>,
is exceedingly piquant, and many of the humorous points
are really good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Countess tells an old story of the Princesse de Talleyrand,
which will better bear repetition than <span class='it'>some</span> of the
novelties of the work. Denon was to dine at Talleyrand’s
at a time when the Baron’s work on Egypt was the common
topic in Paris. The Prince wished the Princess to read a
few pages of the book, that she might be able to say some
words of compliment to the author. He consequently ordered
his librarian to send the work to her apartment on the
morning of the day of the dinner; but unfortunately also
commanded that a copy of Robinson Crusoe should be sent
to a young <span class='it'>protégée</span> of hers who resided in the hotel. Denon’s
work, by mistake, was given to Mademoiselle, and
Crusoe to the Princess, who, at dinner, expressed graciously
to the Baron the delight she had received from his
publication, and propounded many anxious inquiries after
the fate of his poor man, Friday!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon such subjects as are embraced in the following passages,
the Countess is particularly at home:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I observe a difference in the usages <span class='it'>de mœurs</span> at Paris,
and in those of London, of which an ignorance might lead
to give offence. In England, a lady is expected to bow to a
gentleman before he presumes to do so to her, thus leaving
her the choice of acknowledging his acquaintance, or not;
but in France it is otherwise, for a man takes off his hat to
every woman whom he has ever met in society, although
he does not address her, unless she encourages him to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Paris, if two men are walking or riding together, and
one of them bows to a lady of his acquaintance, the other
also takes off his hat, as a mark of respect to the lady known
to his friend, although he is not acquainted with her. The
mode of salutation is also much more deferential towards
women in France than in England. The hat is held a second
longer off the head, the bow is lower, and the smile of recognition
is more <span class='it'>aimable</span>, by which I mean, that it is meant
to display the pleasure experienced by the meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true that the really well bred Englishmen are not
to be surpassed in good manners by those of any other
country; but all are not such; and I have seen instances of
men in London acknowledging the presence of ladies, by
merely touching, instead of taking off, their hats when bowing
to them; and though I accounted for this solecism in
good breeding by the belief that it proceeded from the persons
practising it wearing wigs, I discovered that there was
not even so good an excuse as the fear of deranging them,
and that their incivility proceeded from ignorance or <span class='it'>nonchalance</span>,
while the glum countenance of him who bowed
betrayed rather a regret for the necessity of touching his
beaver, than a pleasure at meeting her for whom the salute
was intended.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The French phrases with which the book is interspersed
have not been read, in proof, with sufficient care, and many
awkward blunders occur. At page 100, vol. I, for example,
we have “<span class='it'>Le jeu né vaut pas la chandelle</span>,” and at page
234, of the same volume, “<span class='it'>Que voulezvous, sire-chacun a
son vingt Mars?</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Crump, the author of this little work, is sufficiently
well known to the reading public; and we need scarcely
say that the “World in a Pocket-Book” is all that it professes
to be. Several years have been occupied in its compilation.
It will be found an exceedingly convenient
manual—embracing a wonderful variety of useful and entertaining
matter—the <span class='it'>utile</span>, nevertheless, prevailing very
much, as is right, over the <span class='it'>dulce</span>. The title well explains
the character of the book. We have never seen so much
really useful information compressed into the same limits.
The public is indebted to Mr. Crump for this little volume,
and we hope he may be repaid for the patient research and
labor bestowed upon it.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
